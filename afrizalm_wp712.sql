Then you&#8217;re in the right place. A business email address builds trust among your customers as compared to the generic ones. Hence, it&#8217;s always recommended to use them for your brand.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll show how you can set up a free business email address in 5 minutes.</p>\n<h3>What Is a Business Email Address?</h3>\n<p>A business email address is a professional looking email address that has your business domain name after @ instead of Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s explain it with the help of an example.</p>\n<p>Say, John Doe wants to create an email address for his business ABC limited. So, the professional email address of John Doe should be johndoe@abclimited.com and not something like johndoe.abclimited@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>But do you really need a business email address? The short answer is Yes. Here are some of the reasons why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s brandable and easy to remember.</li>\n<li>It looks professional.</li>\n<li>Customers trust business emails more than the generic ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Create Your Business Email Address</h3>\n<p>Before we get to the &#8220;how&#8221;, first let&#8217;s talk about what we need to get started.</p>\n<p>The most important thing that you need is a domain name. For those who don&#8217;t know, a domain name is the address of your website. For example, when you type google.com in the address bar of your web browser, you&#8217;re directed to the homepage of Google. So google.com is a domain name.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432698\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/domain-name.png\" alt=\"Domain Name\" width=\"562\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/domain-name.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/domain-name-300x106.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Apart from a domain name, you may also have a live website. But that&#8217;s not a requirement for creating your professional email account.</p>\n<p>Now, if you do a quick search on Google, you&#8217;ll find many ways using which you can create a business email. However, you should be careful with this approach as you may end up losing your important data.</p>\n<p>With reliability and security in mind, we&#8217;ll share two methods with you in this article using which you can create your business email address.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s get started with the first method.</p>\n<h3>Create a Business Email Address using Bluehost</h3>\n<p>Though it&#8217;s not a requirement to have a website for your business email, it&#8217;s certainly recommended to have one. Why? Because a website is the best way to promote your brand online.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">start a website</a> for your business, you need two things: a domain name and a web hosting account.</p>\n<p>We already explained what a domain name is.</p>\n<p>But what is a web host? Well, it&#8217;s the place where your website files are situated. And the good news is most web hosting companies provide free business email service to their customers.</p>\n<p>Normally, a domain name will cost you $14.99 per year, whereas the price of the web hosting service starts from $7.99 per month.</p>\n<p>We know it can be a lot for a startup or a single business owner.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we recommend <a title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost</a> for starting a website. Bluehost is one of the oldest web hosting companies and it&#8217;s also recommended by WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">purchase their service</a> starting at $2.75 per month and also get a free domain. Not only that, but they&#8217;ll also provide free professional email service with all their plans. Isn&#8217;t that great?</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start the step by step process.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Get Started</h3>\n<p>First of all, go to the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost website</a> to get things started. We&#8217;ll sign up for their hosting service and also register a domain name for our business.</p>\n<p>So click on the <strong>Get Started Now</strong> button to select a hosting plan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427452\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-web-hosting.png\" alt=\"Bluehost Web Hosting\" width=\"562\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-web-hosting.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-web-hosting-300x190.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bluehost offers three hosting packages to its customers: Basic, Plus, and Choice Plus. All these plans provide tons of features including free email service and a free domain.</p>\n<p>In most cases, the Basic and Plus plans are suitable for most bloggers, startups, and small businesses. And you can always upgrade to a higher plan later.</p>\n<p>So choose a plan as per your needs and then click on <strong>Select</strong> to proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432613\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-hosting-plan.png\" alt=\"Bluehost hosting plan\" width=\"562\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-hosting-plan.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-hosting-plan-300x176.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In the next page, you&#8217;ll have the option to register your free domain name.</p>\n<p>A domain name represents your business, so make sure you use your brand or company name as your domain name. You may read <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/tips-and-tools-to-pick-the-best-domain-for-your-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this guide on how to choose a domain name</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>So enter your preferred name in the text box, select a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/should-you-choose-a-new-domain-extension-for-your-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">domain extension</a>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432615\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/register-domain-name-for-free.png\" alt=\"Register domain name for free\" width=\"562\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/register-domain-name-for-free.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/register-domain-name-for-free-300x153.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If your preferred domain name is not available or already registered, Bluehost will suggest some alternative names.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://www.nameboy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search for some variations</a> of your business name, but make sure you don&#8217;t use hyphens (-) and numbers in your domain name.</p>\n<p>Once a domain name is available for registration, you&#8217;ll be taken to the last step.</p>\n<p>Here you&#8217;ll have to provide various information to Bluehost so that they can create your account. The form on this page is divided into 4 parts: account information, package information, package extras, and payment information.</p>\n<p>While account information asks for personal details like name, address, phone number, and email address, package information lets you select the account plan.</p>\n<p>As far as package extras are concerned, we recommend you to uncheck all the options. You can always purchase them later if you need them.</p>\n<p>Finally, provide your payment information to purchase your Bluehost hosting account. If you want to pay using PayPal, then click on <strong>More payment options</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432622\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-payment-options.png\" alt=\"Bluehost payment options\" width=\"562\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-payment-options.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-payment-options-300x140.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Once done, click on the checkbox to accept the terms and conditions, and then click <strong>submit</strong>.</p>\n<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve successfully created your hosting account. You&#8217;ll now receive a welcome email from Bluehost with important details including your cPanel login credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: cPanel is the place where you can manage your domain name, hosting, and email accounts.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Create Your Business Email Address</h3>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve registered our domain name, its time to create a professional email address for our business.</p>\n<p>So head over to your <a href=\"https://my.bluehost.com/web-hosting/cplogin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost account</a> and click on <strong>Email &amp; Office</strong>, present in the left sidebar. A page will open up showing all the domain names you have in your account.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427473\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-email-office.png\" alt=\"Bluehost Email Office\" width=\"562\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-email-office.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-email-office-300x104.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;ve got a single domain or multiple ones, click <strong>Manage </strong>once you find your business domain name on this page.</p>\n<p>Next, click on the <strong>Create</strong> button, present on the right side of your screen, to open the &#8220;Create an Email Account&#8221; page.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427480\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/create-a-free-business-email-address.png\" alt=\"Create a free business email address\" width=\"562\" height=\"381\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/create-a-free-business-email-address.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/create-a-free-business-email-address-300x203.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here, you&#8217;ll see a simple form asking for a new username and password.</p>\n<p>Your username in most cases should be your name, something like johndoe or john. However, you can also create an email address for your staff or department. Whatever the case may be, make sure the username is short and sweet.</p>\n<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to enter a strong password. You can also use the <strong>Generate</strong> button to get a randomly generated password. Once done, go to the bottom of the page to click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;ve created your first professional email address for your brand. Repeat the same process for creating more accounts.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Access Your Email Account</h3>\n<p>The next important thing is to access our inbox for sending and reading emails.</p>\n<p>To do that, you&#8217;ve to go to your Bluehost dashboard and then click on <strong>Email &amp; Office</strong>. Next, find your domain name and click <strong>Manage</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here you&#8217;ll see your newly created email address.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427484\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-check-email.png\" alt=\"Bluehost Check email\" width=\"562\" height=\"105\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-check-email.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-check-email-300x56.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now click on <strong>Check Email</strong> to access your inbox. This will take you to a new page and will ask you to choose a webmail application.</p>\n<p>Select any one of them to open the inbox of your email account. You can now compose a mail, read your new emails, or even delete the existing ones.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427485\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/webmail-application.png\" alt=\"webmail application\" width=\"562\" height=\"146\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/webmail-application.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/webmail-application-300x78.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Along with the above method, you can also use an email application like Microsoft Outlook 2010 for Windows to check your emails.</p>\n<h3>Setup a Business Email Address using G Suite</h3>\n<p>Before we start, you should know that this method is not free. However, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/gsuite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">G Suite</a> offers tons of features and hence, we decided to include it in this article.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, G Suite is a product of Google and hence, you&#8217;ll be able to use Gmail&#8217;s interface for managing your business email account.</p>\n<p>The basic plan of <a title=\"GSuite\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/gsuite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">G Suite</a> costs $5 per month for each user. It offers 30 GB of space in Google Drive to every user and allows them to access Gmail, Docs, SpreadSheet, Slides, Calendar, and Video conferencing.</p>\n<p>Also, it comes with a 14-days free trial option. So, you can easily try their service first and then decide whether to continue or not.</p>\n<p>Anyways, let&#8217;s get started with the process of setting up your business email address using G Suite.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Get Started</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to get our hands dirty, so head over to the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/gsuite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">G Suite website</a>.</p>\n<p>Here you&#8217;ll find two plans: Basic and Business. For the time being, we recommend you to start with the basic plan.

Repeat the same process for the rest of your team members.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done, tick the checkbox that says &#8220;I added all user email addresses&#8221; and click <strong>Next </strong>to proceed to the domain verification process.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432593\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/create-user-account.png\" alt=\"Create User Account\" width=\"562\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/create-user-account.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/create-user-account-300x179.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If you need a business email just for your own use, then tick that checkbox and proceed to the next step without creating another account. And don&#8217;t worry, you can always create more user accounts later if you want.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Verify Your Domain Name</h3>\n<p>Though you&#8217;ve created your professional email address, it won&#8217;t work until and unless you connect your G Suite account to your domain name. And to do that, you&#8217;ll have to first verify that the domain name belongs to you.</p>\n<p>G Suite offers different methods using which you can complete this step.</p>\n<p>However, if you already have a WordPress website, then you can verify your domain by adding a meta tag in the head section of your homepage and that too with the help of a plugin.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432594\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/verify-domain-using-meta-tag.png\" alt=\"Verify Domain using Meta Tag\" width=\"562\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/verify-domain-using-meta-tag.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/verify-domain-using-meta-tag-300x112.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll use the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Insert Headers and Footers</a> plugin to add the meta tag.</p>\n<p>Go to <strong>Plugins</strong> » <strong>Add New</strong> on your WordPress admin panel and search for <strong>Insert Headers and Footers </strong>in the search bar. Once you find it, install and active it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427571\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/insert-headers-and-footers-plugin.png\" alt=\"Insert Headers and Footers plugin\" width=\"562\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/insert-headers-and-footers-plugin.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/insert-headers-and-footers-plugin-300x197.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>Insert Headers and Footers</strong> and paste the G Suite verification meta tag in the <strong>Scripts in Header</strong> section. Once done, click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Next, head over to your G Suite wizard and check the <strong>I added the meta tag to my homepage</strong> option to proceed to the final setup process.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432595\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/setup-email-meta-tag.png\" alt=\"Setup Email Meta Tag\" width=\"562\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/setup-email-meta-tag.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/setup-email-meta-tag-300x79.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Add MX Records</h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to add MX records to your domain&#8217;s DNS.</p>\n<p>Wait! What is an MX record? An MX or Mail Exchanger record specifies where the email server is for a particular domain so that all the emails can be sent to that server.</p>\n<p>In simple words, you have to make some changes (add MX records) to the settings of your domain so that your emails can be directed to your G Suite account.</p>\n<p>So first of all, open the control panel of your domain registrar or web host and then, go back to the G Suite setup wizard to click <strong>I have opened the control panel for my domain</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427619\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gsuite-mx-records.png\" alt=\"G Suite MX records\" width=\"562\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gsuite-mx-records.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gsuite-mx-records-300x227.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>G Suite will now show you some MX records which you need to add to your domain&#8217;s DNS. Whatever your case may be, the process of adding MX record is similar for every domain registrar or web host.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s show you how to do this on our Bluehost account.</p>\n<p>Go to your Bluehost dashboard and click on <strong>Domain</strong>. Here you&#8217;ll find all your registered domains. So click the checkbox of the domain name for which you want to add MX records.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427615\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-domain-management.png\" alt=\"Bluehost domain management\" width=\"562\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-domain-management.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bluehost-domain-management-300x116.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>On the right side of the page, you&#8217;ll find the option <strong>DNS Zone Editor</strong>. Click on <strong>Manage</strong> to continue.</p>\n<p>Here you&#8217;ll have to enter all the 5 MX records as provided by G Suite. Let&#8217;s start by adding the first entry:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432596\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-mx-records.png\" alt=\"Add MX Records\" width=\"562\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-mx-records.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-mx-records-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Make sure you do this for each MX record and click <strong>Add Record</strong>. If successfully added, the new records will be present under the MX (Mail Exchanger) section on the same page (scroll down to check).</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve added all of them, go to the G Suite wizard and click <strong>I created the new MX records</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll have to delete any existing MX records you had earlier. So go to the DNS zone of your domain and delete all the MX records except the new ones.</p>\n<p>Click on <strong>I have deleted existing MX records</strong> and then on <strong>I saved the MX records</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-432597\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/verify-domain-and-set-up-email.png\" alt=\"Verify domain and set up email\" width=\"562\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/verify-domain-and-set-up-email.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/verify-domain-and-set-up-email-300x210.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, click on <strong>Verify Domain and Set up Email</strong> to complete the verification and setup process.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Access your Email Account</h3>\n<p>In the last step, we&#8217;ve successfully added the MX records and also verified our domain name. So, our business email address is now ready for use.</p>\n<p>But you might be wondering where the option to make payment is. Well, as stated earlier, G Suite comes with a 14 days free trial and hence, you can start paying after that period.</p>\n<p>To manage the user accounts, payments, and more, you can visit the <a href=\"https://admin.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">G Suite Admin panel</a> and do the needful.</p>\n<p>How can you access your G Suite email inbox? You can either go to the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/gmail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gmail website</a> or use the Gmail app on your phone. As simple as that!</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>That&#8217;s it!

Both Stripe and PayPal&#8217;s US fees per transaction are 2.9% + 30¢ and both offer plans with no setup costs, basic monthly fees, or contracts.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427168\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-vs-paypal-vs-square.jpg\" alt=\"stripe-vs-paypal-vs-square\" width=\"562\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-vs-paypal-vs-square.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-vs-paypal-vs-square-300x231.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427175\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/paypal-vs-stripe-uk.jpg\" alt=\"paypal-vs-stripe-uk\" width=\"562\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/paypal-vs-stripe-uk.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/paypal-vs-stripe-uk-300x218.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>So, with both Stripe and PayPal, your business is eligible for lower pricing if you hit a certain number in monthly sales. Stripe fees get lower at $80,000 per month and for PayPal it happens at a much lower sales volume of $3,000 per month.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">Both companies offer nonprofit discounts at 2.2% + 30¢ for US fees.</div>\n<p id=\"micropayments\"><strong>Micropayments</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re processing transactions of less than $10, Stripe offers micropayment support with the same flat rate as your standard fee per transaction. Paypal&#8217;s micropayment rates are 5% + .05¢ per transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"chargebacks\"><strong>Chargebacks/Refunds</strong></p>\n<p>A chargeback is a charge reversal that happens when somebody contacts their bank and reports a transaction on their card that they don&#8217;t agree with or think is fraud. They exist to protect cardholders, but are sometimes over-utilized which can be frustrating since your business will pay a fee for each chargeback that happens.</p>\n<p>Stripe has a chargeback fee of $15, while PayPal&#8217;s chargeback fee is $20.</p>\n<p>Also, if your customer gets a refund, Stripe won&#8217;t return any processing fees to you. On the other hand, PayPal will return just the fixed fee, but not the percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"customer-support\"><strong>Customer Support</strong></p>\n<p>Stripe has several ways to get in touch when you have questions including a help center, social media, and chat support channels (with support reps or developers), plus phone and email support.</p>\n<p>PayPal has multiple ways to get answers to your questions from their customer support team like a community forum, a help center, and social media, plus email, live chat and phone support.</p>\n<p>Even with all these ways to get your questions answered, users still say that the quality of customer service from both Stripe and PayPal can vary from good to poor and is frustrating at times. However, Stripe recently added 24/7 access to both phone and chat support while PayPal&#8217;s support still goes dark at some hours of the day.</p>\n<p>Stripe has also added an option for paid Premium Support with extra features:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-vs-paypal-premium-support-click.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-430468 size-full\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-standard-vs-premium-support-click.jpg\" alt=\"stripe-standard-vs-premium-support-click\" width=\"562\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-standard-vs-premium-support-click.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stripe-standard-vs-premium-support-click-300x256.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p>\n<p id=\"ease-of-use\"><strong>Ease of Use</strong></p>\n<p>Both Stripe and PayPal are known for being super easy to use. Both companies have made it really simple for customers to pay online.</p>\n<p id=\"ease-of-setup\"><strong>Ease of Setup</strong></p>\n<p>Stripe is more customizable over PayPal. However,  to embed a feature like a <strong>Pay With Card</strong> button on your site, Stripe requires a bit more development knowledge and can sometimes be tricky for non-technical users. With WPForms, setup for both Stripe and PayPal is a breeze since they&#8217;re both available in our pre-built form templates with the Stripe and PayPal Standard Addons.</p>\n<p id=\"security\"><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>Both Stripe and PayPal&#8217;s services are PCI Complaint. In other words, they meet the strict standards of the Payment Card Industry and your cardholder data is stored securely.</p>\n<p id=\"availability\"><strong>Availability</strong></p>\n<p>PayPal is available is many more countries than Stripe. Currently, PayPal is offered in <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">200+ countries</a> while Stripe has just <a href=\"https://stripe.com/global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">32+ countries</a> (and growing).</p>\n<p id=\"access-to-funds\"><strong>Access to Funds Time</strong></p>\n<p>Stripe will automatically deposit your funds into your bank account with a 2-day average payout time. On the other hand, your funds are available immediately in your PayPal account with PayPal Standard. However, PayPal averages a 2-4 day payout time when moving your funds from your PayPal account into your bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"compatibility\"><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>\n<p>You can use both Stripe and PayPal with WordPress, and both products are integrated with WPForms.</p>\n<p id=\"data-portability\"><strong>Data Portability</strong></p>\n<p>At some point, you may want to move all your data to another payment processor that is not Stripe or PayPal. This is known as Data Portability.</p>\n<p>Stripe values Data Portability, so they&#8217;ll help you move your credit card data in a PCI Compliant way.</p>\n<p>PayPal won&#8217;t give you this data if you try to switch processors, which can be a headache. For some people, it&#8217;s important to have the choice to be able to move their payment data if they want.</p>\n<p id=\"online-invoicing\"><strong>Online Invoicing</strong></p>\n<p>Stripe and PayPal both have customizable online invoicing. This is free with PayPal, and free with Stripe until you bill over $1 million. You may be surprised how quickly your sales add up.

PayPal will give you free card readers and also has paid card readers you can buy, while Stripe only offers paid card readers.</p>\n<p><strong>Where Payments Are Handled</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Stripe lets people pay you without ever leaving your website. PayPal requires people exit your website to sign in to a PayPal account before being redirected back to your site, which may be undesirable for you if you want to keep your branding consistent from start to finish during your customer&#8217;s buying process.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this step may not bother some business owners as this is a fairly familiar process for many customers, but it&#8217;s a factor to consider.</p>\n<h3>Stripe Pros</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the benefits of using Stripe to collect money online:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flat, predictable rates</li>\n<li>Easy for your customers to use</li>\n<li>Keep and move your customer data</li>\n<li>Customers never leave your site during the buying cycle</li>\n<li>Nonprofit discounts</li>\n<li>No contract required</li>\n<li>Lower chargeback fee ($15)</li>\n<li>24/7 support</li>\n<li>Multiple support options (help center, phone, live chat and email)</li>\n<li>Developer live chat support for complex issues</li>\n<li>PCI Compliant</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stripe Cons</h3>\n<p>This solution might not be a perfect fit for everyone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Isn’t as user-friendly to set up (The WPForms support team has you covered with this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-install-and-use-the-stripe-addon-with-wpforms/\">how to install the Stripe Addon</a>)</li>\n<li>Not as well-known or a household name like PayPal</li>\n<li>Takes longer to access your money (2-day average)</li>\n<li>No fees returned with refunds</li>\n<li>Inconsistent support quality</li>\n<li>Available in fewer countries than PayPal</li>\n<li>Online invoicing only free until $1M in sales</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PayPal Standard Pros</h3>\n<p>Let’s check out some benefits of using PayPal Standard for accepting payments on your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flat, predictable rates</li>\n<li>Easy to setup an account</li>\n<li>Easy for your customers to use</li>\n<li>Integrations with some POS systems if you want to sell in person</li>\n<li>Customers are familiar with and trust PayPal</li>\n<li>Funds are available immediately in your PayPal account</li>\n<li>Nonprofit discounts</li>\n<li>No contract required</li>\n<li>Fixed fees returned with refunds</li>\n<li>Multiple support options (help center, phone, live chat and email)</li>\n<li>PCI Compliant</li>\n<li>Available in 200+ countries</li>\n<li>Free online invoicing</li>\n<li>Free card readers for your storefront</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PayPal Standard Cons</h3>\n<p>Like most things, there are a few downsides to using PayPal Standard to collect payments on your website.

One type of merchant may prefer to go with one payment solution over another.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that with WPForms, you don&#8217;t have to select just one payment solution to accept payments on your website.</p>\n<h3>You Can Use Both</h3>\n<p>To use both Stripe and PayPal, you’ll need to setup accounts with each company.

Then, scroll down to the <strong>Additional Templates</strong> section and type “complaint form” into the search bar.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422676\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-template.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-template.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-template-300x152.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Hover over Complaint Form and click the <strong>Create a Complaint Form</strong> button that appears.</p>\n<p>Once the pre-built complaint form template loads, you’ll notice most of the work is already done for you.</p>\n<p>You’ll see default form fields for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First and Last Name of the person submitting the complaint</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Phone</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Date / Time of incident</li>\n<li>Incident description</li>\n<li>Advice to resolve the issue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the page where you&#8217;ll start to customize your form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-429498\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpforms-complaint-form-default-fields.jpg\" alt=\"wpforms-complaint-form-default-fields\" width=\"562\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpforms-complaint-form-default-fields.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpforms-complaint-form-default-fields-300x227.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to see the complaint form template in action, check out our <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/demo/complaint-form-demo/\">complaint form sample demo</a>.</p>\n<p>This complaint form format gives you a good starting point to customize your form depending on the type you&#8217;re creating. An employee complaint form may need to ask different questions than a customer complaint form, so you have the option to customize your complaint form.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Customize Your Complaint Form Fields</h3>\n<p>To make any changes to a field, click on the field in the right-hand panel. You can also drag the fields to rearrange their order on your complaint form.</p>\n<p>For example, you may want to accept anonymous complaints through your form because you&#8217;re collecting general information and not planning on following up with people individually.</p>\n<p>To do so, simply click on the <strong>Name</strong> field and deselect the <strong>Required</strong> checkbox so that entering a name into the form when filling it out is optional.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422685\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-required-checkbox.jpg\" alt=\"complaint-form-required-checkbox\" width=\"562\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-required-checkbox.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-required-checkbox-300x230.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You might also think about adding a <strong>Multiple Choice</strong> form field to your complaint form template so your users can pick the specific department or service they had a problem with.</p>\n<p>If your customer ran into an issue with your product and they want to send you an image with their complaint, you can add the <strong>File Upload</strong> form field to your complaint form.</p>\n<p>Complaints can be serious, so you can also give your visitors the option to receive a personal call from you or your customer support team at a time that works for them by adding another <strong>Date / Time</strong> field to your form. Using the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/zapier-addon/\">WPForms Zapier Addon</a>, you can integrate your complaint form with your Google Calendar to have the form information automatically added so you’ll never miss a scheduled call.</p>\n<p>When your complaint form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save.</strong></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Complaint Form Settings</h3>\n<p>To begin, go to <strong>Settings </strong><strong>» </strong><strong>General.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422696\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-general-settings.jpg\" alt=\"complaint-form-general-settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-general-settings.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complaint-form-general-settings-300x248.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In this area, you can configure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Name.</strong> Rename your form.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Description.</strong> Give your form a description with details about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Button Text.</strong> Customize the text shown on the submit button.</li>\n<li><strong>Spam Prevention.</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-spam-free-wordpress-contact-forms-the-ultimate-guide/\">Enable the anti-spam honeypot feature</a> to prevent spam complaint form submissions and <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a>. You can use this default feature alongside other types of spam prevention such as recaptcha.</li>\n<li><strong>GDPR Enhancement.</strong> You can disable the storing of entry information and user details, such as IP addresses and user agents, in an effort to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-gdpr-compliant-forms/\">comply with GDPR requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Your Complaint Form Notifications</h3>\n<p>Notifications are an excellent way to known when someone submits an entry to your complaint form.</p>\n<p>To get an email when someone completes your WordPress complaint form, you’ll need to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">set up form notifications in WordPress</a>. Unless you disable the notification feature, you’ll get an email notification whenever someone submits a complaint on your site.</p>\n<p>You can also send multiple notifications when someone completes your complaint form. For example, you can send a notification to yourself and anyone else on your team that might need access to the information submitted in the complaint form.</p>\n<p>Also, if you use <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">smart tags</a>, you can send a notification to your site visitors once they finish your complaint form to let them know you received it.</p>\n<p>You can add important information to this email notification if you’d like. For instance, you can mention when people can expect a follow-up to their complaint.</p>\n<p>For help with this, check out our step by step guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, you have the option to easily brand your notification emails by adding your logo or any image you choose in the custom header image area. The logo/image you choose will show up at the top of email notifications.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422699\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom-Email-Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>This example has a grey background, but you can change the color to something else if you want. These personalized tweaks can make your email notifications look more professional and give them a personal touch.

For help with this step, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-confirmation-wpforms/\">how to setup form confirmations</a>.</p>\n<p>There are 3 different types of confirmations in WPForms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong> This is the default confirmation type that appears after someone hits submit on your form, and it’s customizable. Check out our tips on ways to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/form-success-message-ideas-to-boost-customer-happiness/\">customize your confirmation message to boost your site visitors&#8217; happiness</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Display Page.</strong> Automatically send users to any page on your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Redirect.</strong> Useful if you want to take the user to a different website or specialized URL for more complex development.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 6: Add Your Complaint Form to Your Website</h3>\n<p>After you’ve created your complaint form and changed all the settings to your liking, you need to add your complaint form to your website.</p>\n<p>WPForms lets you add your forms to multiple locations on your site, including your pages, blog posts, and even <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-contact-form-in-wordpress-sidebar-widget/\">sidebar widgets</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the most common placement option: page/post embedding.</p>\n<p>To begin, create a new page or post in WordPress. Then, click inside the first block (the blank area below your page title) and click on the <strong>Add WPForms</strong> icon.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422707\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-complaint-form-to-new-page.jpg\" alt=\"add-complaint-form-to-new-page\" width=\"562\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-complaint-form-to-new-page.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/add-complaint-form-to-new-page-300x207.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>The handy WPForms widget will appear inside of your block. Click on the WPForms dropdown that appears and pick which one of the forms you have already created that you want to insert into your page. Select your complaint form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-429439\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/submit-a-complaint-form-wpforms-dropdown.jpg\" alt=\"submit-a-complaint-form-wpforms-dropdown\" width=\"562\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/submit-a-complaint-form-wpforms-dropdown.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/submit-a-complaint-form-wpforms-dropdown-300x228.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, publish your page or post so your form will appear on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-422705\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/publish-complaint-form-on-new-page.jpg\" alt=\"publish-complaint-form-on-new-page\" width=\"562\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/publish-complaint-form-on-new-page.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/publish-complaint-form-on-new-page-300x220.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>That’s it!

Below are some of my favorite:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/\" title=\"Conversational Forms by WPForms\">Conversational Forms</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/interactive-conversational-forms-example.gif\" alt=\"interactive conversational forms example\" width=\"1030\" height=\"742\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-391720\" /></p>\n<p>Conversational Forms is the first true interactive form layout built exclusively for WordPress that is guaranteed to boost form completion and your overall form conversions (<a href=\"https://wpforms.com/conversational-forms-demo/\" title=\"Conversational Forms Demo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">See Demo</a>).</p>\n<p>Conversational Forms help make your WordPress forms feel more human. Instead of asking all twenty questions at once, Conversational Forms takes the one question at a time approach similar to a face-to-face conversation.</p>\n<p>The full-page conversational form layout makes your form less overwhelming and more personal, leading to a better form completion rate.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/\" title=\"Form Landing Pages by WPForms\">Form Landing Pages</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpformsformpagesaddon-1.png\" alt=\"Form Pages by WPForms\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-366613\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpformsformpagesaddon-1.png 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpformsformpagesaddon-1-300x145.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p>Form Pages addon for WPForms is the first &#8220;distraction free&#8221; form landing page solution for WordPress (<a href=\"https://wpforms.com/form-pages-demo/\" title=\"Form Pages Demo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">see demo</a>).</p>\n<p>It allows you to quickly create a dedicated form landing page without hiring a developer or writing any code in literally less than 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Our distraction-free layout is designed to help you improve your overall form conversions!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-locker-addon/\" title=\"Form Permissions for WPForms\">Form Locker for Permissions &#038; Access Control</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings.png\" alt=\"form locker settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"359\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-370824\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>WPForms Form Locker addon allows you to lock your WordPress forms with various permissions and access control rules, so you can control who can fill out forms on your website.</p>\n<p>This includes: password protected forms, restrict forms to members only, limit the number of total submissions, limit one entry per person, and close form submissions after specific date / time.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/introducing-wpforms-1-5-0-dashboard-widget-dynamic-field-population-wpforms-challenge-and-more/\" title=\"WPForms Challenge and Dashboard Widget\">WPForms Challenge + Dashboard Widget</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/more-steps-in-wpforms-challenge.png\" alt=\"more steps in wpforms challenge\" width=\"562\" height=\"411\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-328672\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/more-steps-in-wpforms-challenge.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/more-steps-in-wpforms-challenge-300x219.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>To stay true to our mission, make smart WordPress forms easy, we created an internal challenge called the &#8220;WPForms challenge&#8221; which basically said users should be able to create a simple form and start collecting entries in less than 5 minutes. </p>\n<p>Every time we added a new feature, it was my goal to stress-test the user workflow and make sure that we always stay true to our mission.</p>\n<p>We made this challenge public in form of a guided wizard inside WPForms to not only help new users experience the WPForms difference, but so that every user can give us feedback and hold us accountable.</p>\n<p>As part of this release, we also added a Dashboard widget to give you a quick overview of your form&#8217;s performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpforms-dashboard-widget-1.png\" alt=\"WPForms Dashboard Widget\" width=\"620\" height=\"452\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-330711\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpforms-dashboard-widget-1.png 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wpforms-dashboard-widget-1-300x219.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/new-stripe-recurring-functionality-for-your-payment-forms/\" title=\"Stripe Recurring Payments\">Stripe Recurring Payments</a> + <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/announcing-wpforms-1-5-1-form-builder-education-translations-and-payment-checkboxes/\" title=\"Payment Checkboxes\">Payment Checkboxes</a></strong></p>\n<p>One of the most requested features last year was Stripe recurring payments, and of course we listened to our users. We updated our Stripe addon to offer recurring payments ability.</p>\n<p>In a later update, we also added another highly requested feature: Payment Checkboxes, so you can create <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-simple-order-form-in-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Create a Simple Order Form in WordPress (Step by Step)\">simple order forms</a> within just clicks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/payment-checkboxes.gif\" alt=\"payment checkboxes\" width=\"586\" height=\"282\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-367410\" /></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/announcing-the-wpforms-gutenberg-block-conditional-form-confirmations-and-more/\" title=\"Conditional Form Confirmations\">Conditional Form Confirmations</a></strong></p>\n<p>One of the most loved features in WPForms is our smart conditional logic. We expanded this feature last year, so you can also use it with your form notification and form confirmations.</p>\n<p>This lets you decide which form confirmation message people after they submit the form based on what they filled out in the form. </p>\n<p>It also lets you create smart form notifications and route the message internally to the right person or team in your organization.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/introducing-new-gdpr-enhancements-for-your-wordpress-forms/\" title=\"GDPR for WPForms\">GDPR Enhancements for WPForms</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gdprenhancements.png\" alt=\"GDPR Enhancements for WPForms\" width=\"620\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-199071\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gdprenhancements.png 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gdprenhancements-300x145.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p>Last year simply cannot be summarized without mentioning GDPR. To help users stay compliant, we added GDPR enhancement features in WPForms for both our Pro and Lite users.</p>\n<p>This included GDPR form field, the ability to disable user cookies, the ability to disable storing of IP addresses, and more.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Coming Next</h3>\n<p>I am truly inspired and proud of what the WPForms team has accomplished in the last 12 months, but there is a lot more to come. We’re working on several new features that you’ve been asking for. Here’s a quick preview of what’s coming next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Entry Export &#8211; this update will focus on many requested features related to exporting.</li>\n<li>New Language Translations &#8211; we&#8217;re planning to translate WPForms into Portuguese and French.</li>\n<li>AJAX Form Submit &#8211; this is another frequently requested feature. It will allow users to submit forms without reloading the page which will make it easy to embed your forms in apps like <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\" title=\"OptinMonster\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> and others.</li>\n<li>WP Mail SMTP Pro &#8211; we acquired <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" title=\"WP Mail SMTP\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WP Mail SMTP plugin</a> to help fix the WordPress email deliverability issues. While the free version is great, we&#8217;re launching a Pro version to add more powerful features and offer proper SMTP setup service.</li>\n<li>and of course a whole lot more &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;re always listening to user feedback for new feature ideas and improvements.

Contact Form</h3>\n<p>Every website needs a contact form. It allows your website visitors an easy way to get in touch with you. </p>\n<p>Since WPBeginner get millions of visitors every month, it&#8217;s important for us to have a contact form that&#8217;s not only reliable, but has a way to block spam.</p>\n<p>WPForms comes with three built-in spam protection solutions: invisible honeypot, Google reCAPTCHA, and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/custom-catpcha-addon/\" title=\"Custom Questions CAPTCHA for WordPress\">custom questions CAPTCHA</a>.</p>\n<p>WPBeginner website uses the combination of invisible honeypot and Google reCAPTCHA which blocks out all spam.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpbeginnercontactform.png\" alt=\"WPBeginner Contact Form\" width=\"620\" height=\"599\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-425142\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpbeginnercontactform.png 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpbeginnercontactform-300x290.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-captcha-wpforms/\" title=\"How to Set Up reCAPTCHA in WPForms\">Setup reCAPTCHA on your WordPress forms</a> to reduce spam form submissions.</p>\n<h3>2. Grow Email List</h3>\n<p>Every industry expert knows that more than 70% of people leaving your website will never return. </p>\n<p>At WPBeginner, it&#8217;s important for us to convert as many website visitors into email subscribers, so we can continue to grow our website traffic and revenue.</p>\n<p>WPForms comes with built-in email marketing integrations for <a title=\"Constant Contact\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/constant-contact/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\">Constant Contact</a>, <a title=\"MailChimp\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/mailchimp/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\">MailChimp</a>, <a title=\"Drip\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/drip/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\">Drip</a>, <a  title=\"GetResponse\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/getresponse-2/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\" >GetResponse</a>, Campaign Monitor, and over 1000+ others through <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/zapier-addon/\" title=\"Zapier Addon\">Zapier</a>.</p>\n<p>WPBeginner website uses WPForms native email marketing integration combined with smart conditional logic to turn all of our contact forms into newsletter signup forms.</p>\n<p>In each form, we add a checkbox field that asks users if they want to receive weekly WordPress tutorials and updates from WPBeginner. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpbeginner-contact-form-optin.png\" alt=\"WPBeginner Contact Form Optin\" width=\"620\" height=\"568\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-425172\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpbeginner-contact-form-optin.png 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpbeginner-contact-form-optin-300x275.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p>We use the conditional logic feature of WPForms to automatically subscribe any user who checks the box to our weekly email newsletter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpforms-conditional-newsletter-signup.png\" alt=\"WPForms Conditional Newsletter Signup Form\" width=\"620\" height=\"390\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-425170\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpforms-conditional-newsletter-signup.png 620w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpforms-conditional-newsletter-signup-300x189.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<h3>3. Reduce Form Abandonment</h3>\n<p>Form abandonment is a real problem. </p>\n<p>WPBeginner uses the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-abandonment-addon/\" title=\"Form Abandonment Addon for WPForms\">form abandonment</a> feature of WPForms to capture partial form submissions on our important business inquiry forms. This helps the team close more partnership deals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WPForms-Form-Abandonment-addon-settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Form Abandonment addon settings\" width=\"468\" height=\"282\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-192194\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WPForms-Form-Abandonment-addon-settings.png 468w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WPForms-Form-Abandonment-addon-settings-300x181.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" /></p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s not live yet, WPBeginner team is also planning to use WPForms&#8217; distraction-free <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/\" title=\"Form Landing Pages for WordPress by WPForms\">form landing pages</a> to reduce form abandonment on some of their lead forms.</p>\n<h3>4. Reader Surveys</h3>\n<p>WPBeginner team regularly conducts reader surveys to gather feedback and make data-driven decisions to grow the website.</p>\n<p>They use WPForms&#8217; powerful <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/\" title=\"Surveys and Polls by WPForms\">survey and polls addon</a> to create smart survey forms, so they can get real-time insights from WPForms interactive survey reports. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Graph-option-in-WPForms-survey-report.gif\" alt=\"Graph option in WPForms survey report\" width=\"756\" height=\"566\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-148990\" /></p>\n<p>Since some of the surveys require more granular permissions &#038; access control, WPBeginner team uses the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-locker-addon/\" title=\"Form Locker Addon\">form locker addon</a> by WPForms to limit the number of total submissions, password-protect forms, and automatically closing submissions after specific date.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings.png\" alt=\"form locker settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"359\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370824\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In the future, they are planning to use WPForms brand new <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/\" title=\"Conversational Forms Addon\">conversational forms addon</a> to improve form completion rate.</p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-block\" style=\"background-color: #659a17 !important; color: #fff !important; padding: 20px 25px !important; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px !important; -moz-border-radius: 4px !important; -webkit-border-radius: 4px !important; line-height: 48px; font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Click here to join our affiliate program\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/conversational-forms-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to see Conversational Form Demo</a></p>\n<h3>5.

As part of their filtering process, many email providers will check whether your email originates from the same domain noted in the From Email. For example, if your email claims to be sent from your Gmail address but is actually sent from your website&#8217;s server (rather than Gmail&#8217;s server), your email may be sent to spam or not be delivered at all.</p>\n<p>You can fix this by using SMTP instead of the PHP mail function. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the industry standard for sending emails reliably.</p>\n<h3>Why Use the WP Mail SMTP Plugin?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit of using the WP Mail SMTP plugin is that it lets you send WordPress emails securely using your Gmail or G Suite account without requiring to enable less secure apps in your account.</p>\n<p>In addition, unlike many other SMTP options, you won’t need to enter your Gmail username and password in your WordPress dashboard where other site users can see them. By using this method, you&#8217;ll help to <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ultimate Guide to WordPress Security\">keep your WordPress site secure</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how to set up WP Mail SMTP for sending WordPress emails.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Install the WP Mail SMTP Plugin</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WP Mail SMTP</a> plugin. For step-by-step instructions, you can check out <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\">WPBeginner&#8217;s guide on how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>After installing and activating WP Mail SMTP, go to <strong>Settings » WP Mail SMTP</strong> to open the plugin settings page. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-page-1.png\" alt=\"Open WP Mail SMTP settings page\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423553\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-page-1.png 450w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-page-1-300x206.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></p>\n<p>At the top of this page, you&#8217;ll see the <strong>From Email</strong> and <strong>From Name</strong>. You can ignore these settings, because Google will automatically force these values to match the email account used in the next step.</p>\n<p>To start the setup process, you&#8217;ll need to scroll to the <strong>Mailer</strong> field and select the <strong>Google</strong> option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-Google-mailer-option-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-1.png\" alt=\"Select Google mailer option in WP Mail SMTP\" width=\"562\" height=\"214\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423571\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-Google-mailer-option-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-1.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-Google-mailer-option-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-1-300x114.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\"><strong>Note:</strong> Google&#8217;s API (used by the Google mailer) will not allow you to customize certain aspects of your emails, such as the Reply To email address. If this is an important option in your project, please consider using <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-fix-wordpress-contact-form-not-sending-email-with-smtp/\" title=\"How to Fix WordPress Contact Form Not Sending Email With SMTP\">an alternative mailer option</a>.</div>\n<p>You can skip the <strong>Return Path</strong> checkbox, as Google does not allow this setting to be altered.</p>\n<p>Next, you should see a new Gmail section appear. Here, you&#8217;ll see fields for <strong>Client Secret</strong> and <strong>Client ID</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-section-of-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png\" alt=\"Gmail section of WP Mail SMTP settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423589\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-section-of-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-section-of-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>To get the information for these fields, you&#8217;ll need to create a web application through your Google account. This doesn&#8217;t require any coding, and we&#8217;ll show you exactly what to do.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Create a Web Application</h3>\n<p>To create an application, you&#8217;ll first need to <a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail&#038;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sign into your Gmail account and access Gmail&#8217;s application registration</a>. Clicking that link should open this Google page in a new tab or window, and you&#8217;ll want to keep your site settings open (we&#8217;ll return to those later).</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve followed that link and logged into your Gmail account, you should see a form named &#8220;Register your application for Gmail API in Google API Console&#8221;. </p>\n<p>In the dropdown labeled <strong>Select a project where your application will be registered</strong>, leave the default option of <strong>Create a project</strong>. In some cases, you may also be asked to agree to terms of service.</p>\n<p>After filling out this form, go ahead and click the <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-a-new-project-for-Google-application.jpg\" alt=\"Create a new project for Google application\" width=\"562\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423633\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-a-new-project-for-Google-application.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-a-new-project-for-Google-application-300x172.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you should see a screen that says &#8220;The API is enabled&#8221;. To proceed to the setup page, click the <strong>Go to credentials</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-API-is-enabled.png\" alt=\"Gmail API is enabled\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423593\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-API-is-enabled.png 500w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-API-is-enabled-300x123.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>In the next page, you’ll be prompted to determine the credentials you need. Here are the fields on this page and the options you&#8217;ll need to select:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Which API are you using?</strong> Gmail API</li>\n<li><strong>Where will you be calling the API from?</strong> Web server (e.g. node.js, Tomcat)</li>\n<li><strong>What data will you be accessing?</strong> User data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve made these selections, click the <strong>What credentials do I need?</strong> button to go to the next step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project.png\" alt=\"Add credentials to Gmail app project\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423600\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project.png 500w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project-292x300.png 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>After clicking this button, Google will show a popup asking you to set up a consent screen. Go ahead and click on the <strong>Set Up Consent Screen Option</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-OAuth-consent-screen.png\" alt=\"Open OAuth consent screen\" width=\"562\" height=\"279\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-422938\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-OAuth-consent-screen.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-OAuth-consent-screen-300x149.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>This will open a new tab or window. Be sure to keep the original tab/window open, as we&#8217;ll return to it a little later.</p>\n<p>In the new tab/window, you&#8217;ll be asked for several details to prepare your consent screen. This is the permissions screen that will display to you later in the setup process (never seen by your users).</p>\n<p>If you have a G Suite account, you&#8217;ll first set <strong>Application type</strong> to <strong>Internal</strong>. You will not see this option if you&#8217;re using an @gmail.com email account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-internal-application-type.jpg\" alt=\"Select internal application type\" width=\"562\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423628\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-internal-application-type.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-internal-application-type-300x203.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>For <strong>Application name,</strong> you can add the name of your website (or any other name that feels logical to you).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fill-in-app-details.png\" alt=\"Fill in app details\" width=\"562\" height=\"365\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-422941\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fill-in-app-details.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fill-in-app-details-300x195.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, you can skip down to <strong>Authorized domains</strong> and add the URL for your website. Be sure to not include <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> here.</p>\n<p>For <strong>Application Homepage link</strong>, <strong>Application Privacy Policy link</strong>, and <strong>Application Terms of Service link</strong>, you can again just add your website URL. You don&#8217;t need to have special privacy or terms pages in place for this app, as again this consent screen will only ever be seen by you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-authorized-domain-information-to-Google-consent.png\" alt=\"Add authorized domain information to Google consent\" width=\"588\" height=\"562\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423477\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-authorized-domain-information-to-Google-consent.png 588w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-authorized-domain-information-to-Google-consent-300x287.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re ready, click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of this screen.</p>\n<p>After saving your consent screen settings, Google will take you back to an API credentials screen. You can ignore this, and instead return to the first tab/window. </p>\n<p>For this step, you&#8217;ll be creating an OAuth client ID. OAuth, or Open Authorization, is what will provide permission for your website to use your Gmail account to authenticate emails.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter anything you like or leave the default name. This is only for reference within your Google account.</p>\n<p>For <strong>Authorized JavaScript origins</strong>, you&#8217;ll need to enter your site&#8217;s URL.</p>\n<p>Last, we need to fill out the <strong>Authorized redirect URIs</strong> field. To get the URI for your site, you&#8217;ll need to go back to the tab or window with your WordPress site. Still on the <strong>Settings &raquo; WP Mail SMTP</strong> page, you&#8217;ll need to look under the Gmail section for the field labeled <strong>Authorized redirect URI</strong>.</p>\n<p>The value in this field should be your site&#8217;s URL followed by some extra details.

Here are some of the possible error messages and how to resolve them.</p>\n<p><strong>401. That’s an error.<br />\nError: invalid_client</strong><br />\nThis error appears when the Client ID isn&#8217;t able to be read properly. To fix, try copying the Client ID in again and check that there&#8217;s no whitespace or extra text.</p>\n<p><strong>400. That’s an error.<br />\nError: invalid_request<br />\nMissing required parameter: client_id</strong><br />\nThis error will display when the Client ID field is empty or not able to be read properly. To fix, copy in the Client ID again and be careful to not add extra text or whitespace.</p>\n<p><strong>cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem</strong><br />\nThis message means that the server is missing a certificate that’s required for SMTP to work. To fix, you&#8217;ll need to contact your site&#8217;s hosting provider to ask them to install this certificate (most likely the cacert.pem certificate, though it&#8217;s best to ask your host to check).</p>\n<p><strong>“code”: 401,<br />\n“message”: “Login Required”</strong><br />\nIf you see this in the debug message, permission still needs to be granted to your use Google account. For instructions on how to fix this, please see <a href=\"#step-3\" title=\"Step 3: Grant Permissions and Send Test Email\">Step 3</a> of this tutorial. Also, be sure to check that the From Email in your SMTP settings matches the email used to setup the Google app.</p>\n<h6>What If I Want to Switch to A Different Email Later?</h6>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to change to a different Gmail/G Suite email address, you&#8217;ll need to repeat all tutorial steps above. This includes generating a new Client ID and Client Secret under this other email account.</p>\n<p>When you get to the Authorization step (under Step 3), save your settings and then click the <strong>Remove Connection</strong> button. This will remove the authorization for your original email account and allow you to repeat the authorization steps with the new email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP.png\" alt=\"Remove connection in WP Mail SMTP\" width=\"703\" height=\"124\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-223847\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP.png 703w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-300x53.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" /></p>\n<p>That’s it!

And if they don’t, and give you a hassle, just be happy you avoided having to deal with them later after you’ve edited your film and they want out of it.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how to create a video release form in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a Video Release Form in WordPress</h3>\n<p>Using WPForms is the easiest way to create a standard video release form in WordPress.

You can also click on a form field and drag it to rearrange the order on your Video release form.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to require a parent or guardian signature on your forms because it’s a video release form for minors, add the <strong>Signature</strong> form field to your video release form template.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-390993\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/signature-form-field-example.png\" alt=\"signature form field example\" width=\"562\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/signature-form-field-example.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/signature-form-field-example-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Just make sure to select the <strong>Required</strong> checkbox so parents or guardians can’t submit their form without a signature.</p>\n<p>You might also consider adding Name, Email, or Phone form fields to your video release form template so you can get in touch with people you’ve recorded later for any reason.</p>\n<p>When your video release form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your Video Release Form Settings</h3>\n<p>To start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can configure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Name.</strong> Rename your form here.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Description.</strong> Give your form a description.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Button Text.</strong> Customize the copy on the submit button.</li>\n<li><strong>Spam Prevention.</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-a-spam-free-contact-form-without-captcha/\">Enable the anti-spam honeypot feature</a> to prevent spam race submissions and <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a>. This feature is automatically enabled on all WordPress forms. If you decide to use another form of spam prevention, you can either unclick this option or continue using this feature with other spam prevention features such as recaptcha.</li>\n<li><strong>GDPR Enhancements.</strong> You can disable the storing of entry information and user details, such as IP addresses and user agents, in an effort to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-gdpr-compliant-forms/\">comply with GDPR requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Video Release Form Notifications</h3>\n<p>Notifications are a great way to send an email whenever someone submits a video release form on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, unless you disable this feature, whenever someone submits a video release form on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">use smart tags</a>, you can also send a notification to people who fill out a video release form, letting them know you’ve received their form and will be in contact shortly if need be. This assures people their release form has gone through properly.</p>\n<p>You can also add important information to the notification about their video release form and the footage that was taken of them. For instance, you can mention where they might be able to view their footage when it airs. You can also include information about when and where the footage was taken so there’s no confusion later on.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>You can send more than one notification when someone submits a video release form on your site. For example, you can send a notification to yourself, those that were recorded, and anyone on your production team that might need access to the release, and later the actual footage.</p>\n<p>For help doing this, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want to keep branding across your emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>This will give your video release form a professional touch and make people filling it out feel more at ease when releasing their rights to the video footage.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Your Video Release Form Confirmations</h3>\n<p>Form confirmations are messages that display to people once they submit a video release form on your website. They let people know that their form has gone through and offer you the chance to let them know what the next steps are.</p>\n<p>WPForms has three confirmation types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong> This is the default confirmation type in WPForms. When someone submits a video release form, a simple message confirmation will appear letting them know their form was received and is being processed.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Page.</strong> This confirmation type will take customers to a specific web page on your site thanking them. For help doing this, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-redirect-users-after-wordpress-form-submit/\">redirecting customers to a thank you page</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to URL (Redirect).</strong> This option is used when you want to send people to a different website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s see <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-confirmation-wpforms/\">how to set up a simple form confirmation in WPForms</a> so you can customize the message people will see when they fill out a video release form on your website.</p>\n<p>To start, click on the <strong>Confirmation</strong> tab in the Form Editor under <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, select the type of confirmation type you’d like to create. For this example, we’ll select <strong>Message</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246854\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png\" alt=\"Confirmation Message\" width=\"562\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message-300x155.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, customize the confirmation message to your liking and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Add Your Video Release Form to Your Website</h3>\n<p>After you’ve created a video release form, you need to add it to your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>WPForms allows you to add your forms to many locations on your website, including your blog posts, pages, and even <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-contact-form-in-wordpress-sidebar-widget/\">sidebar widgets</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the most common post/page embed option.</p>\n<p>To start, create a new post or page in WordPress and then click on the <strong>Add Form</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Next, select your video release form in the modal popup and click <strong>Add Form</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-390991\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/add-video-release-form.png\" alt=\"add video release form\" width=\"562\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/add-video-release-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/add-video-release-form-300x189.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, publish your post or page so your form will appear on your website.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!

As a site owner, you need to give your readers an easy way to get in touch with you.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to create a simple contact form in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Why Create a Simple Contact Form in WordPress?</h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re a new website owner, you may wonder <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/contact-form-vs-email-address-which-is-better/\">whether to use a contact form or provide an email address</a> on your website.</p>\n<p>To help answer that question, here are the benefits of adding a contact form to your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Communication. </strong>Contact forms are a great way to allow your readers to quickly communicate with you.</li>\n<li><strong>Security. </strong>You keep your email safe from spammers. Since your contact form doesn’t show your email address, spammers can’t steal it.</li>\n<li><strong>Organization. </strong>With a contact form you can create <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/101-email-subject-lines-your-subscribers-cant-resist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">specific subject lines</a>, so people always know their emails are coming from you, and more importantly what the email is about.</li>\n<li><strong>Information. </strong>You control the information collected by adding only the fields you want site visitors to fill out on the form. This cuts down on the back and forth emails between you and a potential client.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at how to create a simple contact form in WordPress both by taking the WPForms Challenge and the traditional way you’ll create forms after knowing how to use WPForms.</p>\n<p>Here are some quick links to make things easier on you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#wpforms-challenge\">Take the WPForms Challenge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#create-contact-form\">Create a Simple Contact Form</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"wpforms-challenge\">Take the WPForms Challenge – Create a Form in Under 5 Minutes</h3>\n<p>We created WPForms with the intention of it being the easiest, most beginner friendly form builder plugin in the market. And to prove that to you, we created the WPForms Challenge. We challenge all new users of WPForms to create their first form <strong>in under 5 minutes</strong> to show them just how simple this contact form solution is.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms plugin</a>. For more details, see this step by step guide on <a title=\"Step by step guide on How to Install a WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to install a plugin in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Once activated, you’ll be prompted with WPForms’ setup wizard and the option to take the WPForms Challenge.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Start the WPForms Challenge</strong> to get started.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-397505\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/start-the-wpforms-challenge.png\" alt=\"start the wpforms challenge\" width=\"562\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/start-the-wpforms-challenge.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/start-the-wpforms-challenge-300x133.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create Your First Form</strong></p>\n<p>You’ll be taken immediately to the WPForms form builder when you start the WPForms Challenge. This is where you’ll create your first form and configure all of its settings.</p>\n<p>You’ll see in the bottom right hand corner that there is a convenient checklist that will follow you as you create your form so you know you haven’t missed any steps. It also has a timer to show you how long you&#8217;ve spent creating your form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-397499\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/challenge-checklist-and-timer.png\" alt=\"challenge checklist and timer\" width=\"562\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/challenge-checklist-and-timer.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/challenge-checklist-and-timer-300x185.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>The first step in the challenge is to name your form. For our example, we’ll name our form Simple Contact Form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-397502\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/name-your-form.png\" alt=\"name your form\" width=\"562\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/name-your-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/name-your-form-300x92.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Click <strong>Done</strong> to move to the next step. You&#8217;ll see in the next step that the checklist has crossed out the Name Your Form step. This shows you that you’re on the right track.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Customize Your Form Fields</strong></p>\n<p>Next it’s time to select a pre-designed template or use the blank template if you prefer to build your form from scratch. Since we’re creating a contact form, we’ll select the <strong>Simple Contact Form</strong> template.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-397503\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/select-a-template.png\" alt=\"select a template\" width=\"562\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/select-a-template.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/select-a-template-300x245.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>When you click on the template you want to use, you’ll be taken to the part in the form builder that lets you add or remove form fields and customize the way they look and function.

When a site visitor submits a contact form, a simple message confirmation will appear letting them know their form was processed.

But first, let’s take a quick look at the general form settings you might want to configure before creating your distraction free conversational form.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Form Settings</h3>\n<p>There are many settings to configure once you’ve customized your form to look the way you want it to.</p>\n<p><strong>General Settings</strong></p>\n<p>To start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can change things like your form’s name, description, and submit button copy.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-spam-free-wordpress-contact-forms-the-ultimate-guide/\">enable additional spam prevention features</a> to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a> from unwanted form submissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Form Notifications</strong></p>\n<p>Notifications are a great way to send an email whenever a form is submitted on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, unless you disable this feature, whenever someone submits a form on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need to send more than one notification, for example to yourself, a team member, and your site visitor, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you want to keep branding across your emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Form Confirmations</strong></p>\n<p>Form confirmations are messages that display to site visitors once they submit a form on your website. They let people know that their form has been processed and offer you the chance to let them know what the next steps are.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246854\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png\" alt=\"Confirmation Message\" width=\"562\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message-300x155.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>WPForms has three confirmation types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong>A simple message that displays once someone submits a form on your website thanking them and letting them know what the next steps are.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Page.</strong> Redirect users to another page on your website, such as a thank you page.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to URL (Redirect).</strong> Send site visitors to a different website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to display different confirmations to site visitors based on their behavior, be sure to read up on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-conditional-form-confirmations/\">how to create conditional form confirmations</a>.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Conversational Forms Settings</h3>\n<p>Now that you have your form’s general settings configured it’s time to configure your conversational form settings.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>Conversational Forms</strong> in the form builder and click on the <strong>Enable Conversational Form Mode</strong> checkbox.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-397404\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/enable-conversational-forms.png\" alt=\"enable conversational forms\" width=\"562\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/enable-conversational-forms.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/enable-conversational-forms-300x139.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>When you do this, you’ll see a bunch of settings that you can customize to meet your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Form Title and Message</strong></p>\n<p>To start, give your form a title that will display for your site visitors. This is good for letting people know what your form is all about and what action you want them to take while there.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-397401\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/conversational-forms-title.png\" alt=\"conversational forms title\" width=\"562\" height=\"189\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/conversational-forms-title.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/conversational-forms-title-300x101.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you can add a short message for your site visitors to see.

Want to know which is the best WordPress eCommerce plugin? </p>\n<p>Choosing the right eCommerce plugin is crucial for your business because a better platform means more opportunity for growth. Often users end up losing money because they didn&#8217;t do proper research when choosing the eCommerce platform to start their store. </p>\n<p>In this article, we will compare the 5 best WordPress eCommerce plugins for 2019. We will also explain their pros and cons to help you find which eCommerce plugin is right for your business. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Best WordPress eCommerce plugins\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wpecommerceplugins.png\" alt=\"Best WordPress eCommerce plugins\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61904\" /></p>\n<h4>What to Look for in a WordPress eCommerce Plugin for Your Site?</h4>\n<p>There are plenty of WordPress eCommerce plugins in the market. But not all of them have the right set of features for your use-case. </p>\n<p>For example, some eCommerce plugins are made for selling digital goods like eBooks, photos, music, etc. Others are better suited for selling physical products that need shipping. </p>\n<p>If you want to run a drop-shipping business, then you&#8217;ll need an eCommerce solution that provides better support for drop-shipping.  </p>\n<p>Basically, you need to consider what you will be selling and what kind of features you would need to efficiently run your online store.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, following are some of the most important factors you need to look for when choosing an eCommerce platform. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Payment solutions</strong> &#8211; Your eCommerce plugin should have support for your preferred payment gateways by default or through an extension. </li>\n<li><strong>Design and customization</strong> &#8211; Your store&#8217;s design is your customer&#8217;s first interaction with your business. Make sure there are plenty of templates and easy customization options available</li>\n<li><strong>Apps and integrations</strong> &#8211; Check out integrations available for third-party apps like <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/\" title=\"7 Best Email Marketing Services for Small Business (2019)\">email marketing services</a>, CRM software, <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-accounting-software-for-small-businesses-compared/\" title=\"6 Best Accounting Software for Small Businesses (Compared)\">accounting software</a>, etc. You&#8217;ll need those tools to manage and grow your ecommerce business more effeciently.  </li>\n<li><strong>Support options</strong> &#8211; Make sure that there are support options available. Good support can save you a lot of money in the long run.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What Do You Need to Run an eCommerce Website?</h4>\n<p>Ecommerce websites are resource intensive, so the first thing you will need is the <a title=\"How to Choose The Best WordPress Hosting?\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\">best WordPress hosting</a> that you can afford.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on a budget, then you can start with <a title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost</a>. The Ecommerce plan comes with SSL Certificate which you need to collect payments securely, dedicated IP, and a dedicated support line. They also install WooCommerce by default, which is the most powerful WordPress Ecommerce plugin (as you&#8217;ll find out later in this article). </p>\n<p>If budget is not an issue, and you want the best performance, then we recommend using a <a title=\"When Do You Really Need Managed WordPress Hosting?\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/managed-wordpress-hosting/\">managed WordPress hosting</a> provider like <a title=\"WPEngine\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wpengine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">WPEngine</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, you will need to choose a domain name for your website. Here is our guide on <a title=\"How to Pick the Right Domain Name\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/tips-and-tools-to-pick-the-best-domain-for-your-blog/\">how to pick the right domain name</a> for your eCommerce site.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you will need to choose <a title=\"24 Must Have WordPress Plugins for Business Websites in 2016\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/\">essential business plugins</a> that you will need such as <a title=\"OptinMonster\" href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OptinMonster</a> which help you <a title=\"11 Advanced Tips to Reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment\" href=\"https://optinmonster.com/11-advanced-tips-to-reduce-shopping-cart-abandonment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce shopping cart abandonment</a> and increase sales.</p>\n<p>Having that said, let&#8217;s take a look at the best WordPress eCommerce plugins.</p>\n<h4>Best WordPress Ecommerce Plugins &#8211; The Contenders</h4>\n<p>Now that you know what to look for in an eCommerce platform and what you need to get started, here are our top picks for the best eCommerce platform for WordPress users.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#woocommerce\">WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bigcommerce\">BigCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#easydigitaldownloads\">Easy Digital Downloads</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#memberpress\">MemberPress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#shopify\">Shopify</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each one of them and compare their pros and cons. </p>\n<h4 id=\"woocommerce\"><a title=\"WooCommerce\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">1. WooCommerce</a></h4>\n<p><a title=\"WooCommerce\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img title=\"WooCommerce\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/woocommerce.png\" alt=\"WooCommerce\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61906\" /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce is the most popular WordPress eCommerce plugin. It is also the most popular eCommerce platform in the world. WooCommerce was acquired by Automattic (the company behind <a title=\"Self Hosted WordPress.org vs. Free WordPress.com\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/self-hosted-wordpress-org-vs-free-wordpress-com-infograph/\">WordPress.com</a> blog hosting service) in 2015.</p>\n<p>There is a large number of addons and themes available for WooCommerce. They also have a passionate developer community behind it. Recently several hosting companies have started creating specialized <a title=\"Best WooCommerce Hosting in 2019 (Reviews &amp; Performance Tests)\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/best-woocommerce-hosting/\">WooCommerce hosting</a> solutions.</p>\n<h4>Pros of Using WooCommerce</h4>\n<p>Here are some of the advantages of using WooCommerce as your WordPress eCommerce plugin:</p>\n<p><strong>Extensions and Themes</strong> &#8211; There are hundreds of extensions and themes available for WooCommerce, which makes it easy for you to add new features to your eCommerce site. Large collection of themes means you have tons of options when choosing your site&#8217;s design and layout.</p>\n<p><strong>Supports Both Digital and Physical Goods</strong> &#8211; With WooCommerce, you can sell physical as well as digital downloads (such as ebooks, music, software, and more). </p>\n<p><strong>Sell Affiliate or External Products</strong> &#8211; Using WooCommerce, you can add affiliate or external products to your site. <a title=\"10 Best Affiliate Marketing Tools and Plugins for WordPress\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/10-best-affiliate-marketing-tools-and-plugins-for-wordpress/\">Affiliate marketers</a> can create product sites and provide users a better experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete Inventory Management</strong> &#8211; WooCommerce comes equipped with tools to easily manage your inventory or even assign it to a store manager.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment and Shipping Options</strong> &#8211; WooCommerce has built-in support for popular payment gateways, and you can add many other payment options using extensions. It can also calculate shipping and taxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Support and Documentation</strong> &#8211; There is excellent documentation available online for WooCommerce. Apart from documentation, there is knowledge base, help desk, and community forums available.</p>\n<h4>Cons of Using WooCommerce</h4>\n<p><strong>Too Many Options</strong> &#8211; WooCommerce is very easy to use, but the number of options available on the settings page can be quite intimidating for a new user.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding Addons</strong> &#8211; There are lots of addons available for WooCommerce, sometimes a user may not find the right addon for features that they need.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Support</strong> &#8211; WooCommerce works with any WordPress theme, but it is not always as easy to setup or good looking with all themes. You need a WooCommerce ready theme to take full advantage of its features without too much hassle.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability</strong> &#8211; As your store gets larger, you will need to move to a managed hosting provider like <a title=\"WPEngine\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wpengine/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" >WP Engine</a> to scale your WooCommerce store.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is the perfect choice for any kind of eCommerce website. It has a large community of developers and users, a lot of addons and themes, excellent support for <a title=\"How to Easily Create a Multilingual WordPress Site\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-easily-create-a-multilingual-wordpress-site/\">multilingual websites</a>, and best free and paid support options.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bigcommerce\"><a title=\"BigCommerce\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bigcommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\">2.

This allows you to use a scalable eCommerce platform while using WordPress to manage your content and run your website. </p>\n<p>It has a powerful integration plugin for WordPress which makes it very easy to embed your products in WordPress. It automatically creates the sign in, cart, account, and other important pages for you. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using BigCommerce as your WordPress eCommerce platform. </p>\n<h4>Pros of Using BigCommerce</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High scalability</strong> &#8211; It includes all the features you will need with enterprise grade security, high performance, and easy scalability. </li>\n<li><strong>Less Maintainence</strong> &#8211; Keeping your eCommerce engine separate from other content makes it easier to run your WordPress site. </li>\n<li><strong>Sell across Multiple Channels</strong> &#8211; You can use it to sell not only on your website but also on other channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Amazon. </li>\n<li><strong>No transaction charges</strong> &#8211; Unlike some other eCommerce platforms, it does not charge you on each transaction. You can choose from dozens of top payment gateways and only pay the payment service provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons of Using BigCommerce</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited Integrations</strong> &#8211; BigCommerce integrates with all the top third-party apps and tools. However, its app store is still growing, and you may not find an integration for some less popular apps.</li>\n<li><strong>No Mobile App</strong> &#8211; Currently, it does not have a mobile app to manage your store on the go.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BigCommerce is an incredibly powerful yet very easy to use eCommerce platform. It is a SaaS eCommerce platform, but with their <a title=\"BigCommerce WordPress\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bigcommerce-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\">BigCommerce WordPress plugin</a> you can have the best of both worlds.  </p>\n<p>It takes away the pains of scaling your hosting requirements as your business grows. At the same time, you don&#8217;t have to worry about security, performance, or finding extensions for SEO and caching.</p>\n<p>BigCommerce is a rising contender in WordPress for headless eCommerce. It takes care of technology infrastructure, so you can focus on growing your business.</p>\n<h4 id=\"easydigitaldownloads\"><a title=\"Easy Digital Downloads\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/easy-digital-downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">3.

Make sure that your web host supports wildcard subdomains before setting up multisite. </p>\n<p>Following are some other common issues and their quick fixes. </p>\n<p><strong>Fixing login issues on multisite installs</strong></p>\n<p>Another common issue is that when using WordPress multisite with sub-directories, some users are unable to login to the admin area of their sites after they add the required code in wp-config.php file.</p>\n<p>To fix this, try replacing</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\r\ndefine(\'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL\', false);\r\n</pre>\n<p>line in wp-config.php file with</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\r\ndefine(\'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL\', \'false\');\r\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Find unconfirmed users</strong></p>\n<p>Another issue that you may come across is not being able to find users who registered on your network but didn&#8217;t get the activation email.

Following are the most frequently asked questions that we have answered. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Would I be able to better manage my sites with a multisite network?</strong> </p>\n<p>To be honest, the answer really depends on your usage scenario. </p>\n<p>For example, if your websites are not related to each other, then you would be better off with a multiple site management tool, like <a title=\"InfiniteWP\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/infinitewp/\" rel=\"nofollow nooperner\" target=\"_blank\">InifiteWP</a>. </p>\n<p>If you manage multiple sites for a restaurant chain, university, or online magazine, then WordPress multisite will be more efficient. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Does WordPress multisite make my websites load faster?</strong></p>\n<p>Once again it depends on several factors. Better WordPress hosting with plenty of server resources will allow multisite to be faster but then again with these resources, individual WordPress sites will also run faster.</p>\n<p>However, on a shared hosting account, traffic spikes will increase memory usage and slow down all websites on the multisite network at the same time. To improve multisite speed, see our guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-performance-speed/\" title=\"The Ultimate Guide to Boost WordPress Speed &amp; Performance\">WordPress performance and speed optimization</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Can I add an online store to a WordPress Multisite Website?</strong> </p>\n<p>Yes, you can <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-start-an-online-store/\" title=\"How to Start an Online Store in 2019 (Step by Step)\">add an online store</a> in WordPress multisite network. Most likely, you will be using an eCommerce plugin like WooCommerce for that, which is compatible with WordPress multisite. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Can I install &#8216;x plugin&#8217; on my WordPress multisite?</strong></p>\n<p>Some WordPress plugins may not be compatible with WordPress multisite. Normally, plugin authors mention it on the plugin&#8217;s website and you can avoid installing a plugin that may not work on a multisite setup. However, if it is not mentioned, then it is safe to assume that it is multisite compatible. </p>\n<p><strong>4. How do I share user logins and roles across the multisite network?</strong> </p>\n<p>By default, a user who is registered on one site cannot register or be added to another site on the same network. That&#8217;s because they are already registered in the shared WordPress database. However, they don&#8217;t have any <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-user-roles-and-permissions/\" title=\"Beginner’s Guide to WordPress User Roles and Permissions\">user role privileges</a> on other sites. </p>\n<p>You can use third-party plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-multisite-user-sync/\" title=\"WP Multisite User Sync\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WP Multisite User Sync</a> to sync users across the network.

Search engines consistently rank fast websites higher. This is also true for the image search. </p>\n<p>Images increase your overall page load time. They take longer to download than text, which means your page loads slower if there are several large image files to download. </p>\n<p>You need to make sure that images on your site are optimized for web. This can be a little tricky to get used to since many beginners are not experts in graphics and image editing. </p>\n<p>We have a handy guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/speed-wordpress-save-images-optimized-web/\" title=\"Speed Up Your WordPress – How to Save Images Optimized for Web\">how to properly optimize images</a> before uploading them to your website. </p>\n<p>The best way to optimize images is by editing them on your computer using a photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop. This allows you to choose the right file format to create a small file size. </p>\n<p>You can also use an <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/best-wordpress-image-compression-plugins-compared/\" title=\"5 Best WordPress Image Compression Plugins Compared\">image compression plugin</a> for WordPress. These image optimizer plugins allow you to automatically reduce file size while uploading an image to WordPress. </p>\n<h4 id=\"whatisalttext\">What is Alt Text?</h4>\n<p>Alt text or alternative text is an HTML attribute added to the <code>img</code> tag which is used to display images on a web page. It looks like this in plain HTML code: </p>\n<p><code>&lt;img src=\"/fruitbasket.jpeg\" alt=\"A fruit basket\" /&gt; </code></p>\n<p>It allows website owners to describe the image in plain text. The main purpose of the alternate text is to improve accessibility by enabling screen readers to read out the alt text for visually impaired users.</p>\n<p>Alt text is also crucial for image SEO. It helps search engines understand the context of the image. </p>\n<p>Modern search engines can recognize an image and it&#8217;s content by using artificial intelligence. However, they still rely on website owners to describe the image in their own words. </p>\n<p>Alt text also accompanies images in Google image search, which helps users understand the image and improves your chances of getting more visitors. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Alt text used in search results\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alttext-searchresults.png\" alt=\"Alt text used in search results\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62143\" /></p>\n<p>Usually, alt text is not visible on your website. However if an image is broken or cannot be found, then your users will be able to see the alternate text with a broken image icon next to it. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Alternate text displayed next to a broken image\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brokenimage.jpg\" alt=\"Alternate text displayed next to a broken image\" width=\"550\" height=\"271\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62183\" /> </p>\n<h4 id=\"alttextvstitle\">What is the Difference Between Alt Text vs Title</h4>\n<p>Alt text is used for accessibility and image SEO, while title field is used internally by WordPress for media search.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Search image by title\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/searchimagebytitle.jpg\" alt=\"Search image by title\" width=\"550\" height=\"271\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62182\" /> </p>\n<p>WordPress inserts the alt tag in the actual code used to display the image. The title tag is stored in the database to find and display images. </p>\n<p>In the past, WordPress inserted the title tag in the HTML code as well. However, it was not an ideal situation from the accessibility point of view, which is why they removed it.  </p>\n<h4 id=\"alttextvscaption\">What is the Difference Between Alt Text vs Caption</h4>\n<p>The alt text is used to describe the image for search engines and screen readers. On the other hand, the caption is used to describe the image for all users. </p>\n<p>Alt text is not visible on your website while captions are visible below your images. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Example of a caption displayed below an image\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/captionexample.jpg\" alt=\"Example of a caption displayed below an image\" width=\"550\" height=\"295\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62184\" /></p>\n<p>The alt text is crucial for better image SEO on your website. The caption is optional and can be used only when you need to provide additional information about the image to website visitors. </p>\n<h4 id=\"howtoadd\">How to Add Alt Text, Title, and Caption to Images in WordPress</h4>\n<p>Alt text, title, and caption make up the image metadata that you can add to images when uploading them into WordPress. </p>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-and-align-images-in-wordpress-block-editor/\" title=\"How to Add and Align Images in WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg)\">add an image</a> using the default image block, WordPress allows you to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-caption-to-images-in-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Add Caption to Images in WordPress\">add caption</a> and alt text for the image. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding alt text and caption to an image in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alttext-caption.png\" alt=\"Adding alt text and caption to an image in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"339\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62179\" /></p>\n<p>It automatically generates a title for the image from the file name. You can change the title by clicking on the edit button in the image block&#8217;s toolbar. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Editing an image in default WordPress editor\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/editimageicon.png\" alt=\"Editing an image in default WordPress editor\" width=\"550\" height=\"311\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62180\" /></p>\n<p>This will bring up the media uploader popup where you can enter your own custom title for the image. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Changing image title in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/changeimagetitle.jpg\" alt=\"Changing image title in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"293\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62181\" /></p>\n<p>You can also edit the alt tag and title for the images that you have already uploaded to WordPress. To do that, you need to visit <strong>Media &raquo; Library</strong> page and locate the image you want to edit. </p>\n<p><img title=\"WordPress media library\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/medialibrary.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress media library\" width=\"550\" height=\"295\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62185\" /></p>\n<p>Simply clicking on an image will bring up the attachment details popup where you can enter title, alt text, and caption. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Add alt tag and title via media library\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/medialibraryedit.jpg\" alt=\"Add alt tag and title via media library\" width=\"550\" height=\"332\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62186\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing an image&#8217;s alt tag or caption via Media Library will not change it in the posts and pages where the image is already used.</p>\n<h4 id=\"captions\">When to Use Captions for Images in WordPress</h4>\n<p>Captions allow you to provide additional details for an image to all your users. They are visible on the screen for all users including search engines and screen readers. </p>\n<p><img title=\"An image gallery with captions for each image\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gallerywithcaptions.jpg\" alt=\"An image gallery with captions for each image\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62187\" /></p>\n<p>As you may have noticed that most websites don&#8217;t normally use captions with images in their blog posts or pages. That&#8217;s because captions are often not needed to explain an image. </p>\n<p>Captions are more suitable in the following scenarios: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Family or event photos</li>\n<li>Photos that need additional explanation describing the background story</li>\n<li>Product image galleries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases, you would be able to explain the image in the article content itself. </p>\n<h4 id=\"disableattachmentpages\">Disable Attachment Pages in WordPress</h4>\n<p>WordPress creates a page for all images you upload to your posts and pages. It is called the attachment page. This page just shows a larger version of the actual image and nothing else. </p>\n<p>This can have a negative SEO impact on your search rankings. Search engines consider pages with little to no text as low quality or &#8216;thin content&#8217;. </p>\n<p>This is why we recommend users to disable the attachment pages on your website. </p>\n<p>The easiest way to do this is by installing and activating the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" title=\"Yoast SEO\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO</a> plugin. For more details, see our step by step guide on <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" title=\"Step by Step Guide to Install a WordPress Plugin for Beginners\">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon activation, it automatically turns off attachment URLs. You can also manually turn off attachment pages in WordPress by visiting <strong>SEO &raquo; Search Appearance</strong> page and clicking on the Media tab. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Disable attachment URLs in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/disableattachment.png\" alt=\"Disable attachment URLs in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"340\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62177\" /></p>\n<p>From here, make sure that the &#8216;Media &amp; attachment URLs&#8217; option is set to &#8216;Yes&#8217;. </p>\n<p>If you are not using Yoast SEO plugin, then you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/attachment-pages-redirect/\" title=\"Attachment Pages Redirect\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Attachment Pages Redirect</a> plugin. This plugin simply redirects people visiting the attachment page to the post where the image is displayed. </p>\n<p>You can also do this manually, by adding the following code to your theme&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/functions-php/\" title=\"What is functions.php File in WordPress?\">functions.php</a> file or a <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-why-and-how-tos-of-creating-a-site-specific-wordpress-plugin/\" title=\"What, Why, and How-To’s of Creating a Site-Specific WordPress Plugin\">site-specific plugin</a>. </p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nfunction wpb_redirect_attachment_to_post() { \r\nif ( is_attachment() ) { \r\nglobal $post;\r\nif( empty( $post ) ) $post = get_queried_object();	\r\nif ($post-&gt;post_parent)	{\r\n	$link = get_permalink( $post-&gt;post_parent );\r\n	wp_redirect( $link, \'301\' );\r\n	exit(); \r\n	}\r\nelse	{\r\n	// What to do if parent post is not available\r\n	wp_redirect( home_url(), \'301\' );\r\n	exit(); \r\n	}\r\n}\r\n}\r\nadd_action( \'template_redirect\', \'wpb_redirect_attachment_to_post\' );\r\n</pre>\n<h4 id=\"imageseotips\">Additional Tips to Improve Image SEO</h4>\n<p>Adding alt tag is not the only thing you can do to improve image SEO. Following are a few additional tips that you should keep in mind when adding images to your blog posts. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Write descriptive alt text</strong> </p>\n<p>Many beginners often just use one or two words as alt text for the image. This makes the image too generic and harder to rank. </p>\n<p>For example, instead of just <em>&#8216;kittens&#8217;</em> use <em>&#8216;Kittens playing with a yellow rubber duck&#8217;</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Use descriptive file names for your images</strong> </p>\n<p>Instead of saving your images as DSC00434.jpeg, you need to name them properly. Think of the keywords that users will type in the search to find that particular image. </p>\n<p>Be more specific and descriptive in your image file names. For example, <em>red-wooden-house.jpeg</em> is better than just <em>house.jpeg</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Provide context to your images</strong> </p>\n<p>Search engines are getting smarter every day. They can recognize and categorize images quite well. However, they need you to provide context to the image. </p>\n<p>Your images need to be relevant to the overall topic of the post or page. It is also helpful to place the image near the most relevant text in your article. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Follow the SEO best practices</strong> </p>\n<p>You also need to follow the overall <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-seo/\" title=\"Ultimate WordPress SEO Guide for Beginners (Step by Step)\">SEO guidelines for your website</a>. This improves your overall <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-check-if-your-wordpress-blog-posts-are-ranking-for-the-right-keywords/\" title=\"How to Check If Your WordPress Blog Posts Are Ranking for the Right Keywords\">search rankings</a> including image search. </p>\n<p><strong>5. Use original photographs and images</strong> </p>\n<p>There are many free stock photography websites that you can use to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/16-sources-for-free-public-domain-and-cc0-licensed-images/\" title=\"16 Sources for Free Public Domain and CC0-Licensed Images\">find free images</a> for your blog posts. However, the problem with stock photos is that they are used by thousands of websites. </p>\n<p>Try to use original photographs or create quality images that are unique to your blog. </p>\n<p>We know that most bloggers are not photographers or graphic designers. Luckily, there are some great online tools that you can use to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/tools-to-create-better-images-for-your-blog-posts/\" title=\"16 Tools to Create Better Images for Your Blog Posts\">create graphics for your websites</a>. </p>\n<p>We hope this article helped you learn about Image SEO for your website.

Using WordPress, you can put your portfolio online on your website to get more business and boost your revenue.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how to easily make an online portfolio with WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Why Should You Make an Online Portfolio?</h3>\n<p>An online portfolio brings many opportunities on board. When presented well, your work&#8217;s quality will truly shine which will impress your site&#8217;s visitors, and they&#8217;ll become your ambassadors.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;re many reasons to create an online portfolio. We&#8217;re listing a few below so you&#8217;ll understand the primary benefits of having your own portfolio page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a business website, you most likely share the services you offer. You should also display your portfolio to show your potential clients your previous accomplishments. A portfolio is visual proof you can perform the services you&#8217;re offering.</li>\n<li>When someone asks you about your portfolio, you won&#8217;t need to send it to them by mail or fax. You can simply share the link to your portfolio page.</li>\n<li>An online portfolio page improves your website&#8217;s search engine rankings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your online portfolio will not only help get you more business, it also connects you with like-minded people who&#8217;re looking to expand their businesses in the same direction. However, you&#8217;ll need to make sure your portfolio looks professional and interesting to reap these benefits.</p>\n<h3>What Does a Good Online Portfolio Look Like?</h3>\n<p>Portfolios can be different for each business or niche. For example, a website development agency would likely display the websites they&#8217;d made; whereas a real estate business would show their construction projects.</p>\n<p>The use of visual content in an engaging way can have more impact than plain, flat text. You can build an eye-catching portfolio by showing your best work first.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/portfolioexample.jpg\" alt=\"Portfolio example\" width=\"775\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229820\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/portfolioexample.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/portfolioexample-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/portfolioexample-768x396.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>With a WordPress website, you can use an image gallery or photo slider to present your portfolio. If you use an image gallery plugin, you can also add text accompanying the images to explain your work. The more presentable a portfolio you make, the more you&#8217;ll engage with your users.</p>\n<p>That said, let&#8217;s take a look at how you can build a beautiful online portfolio with WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Building an Online Portfolio with WordPress</h3>\n<p>Now that you know why do you need an online portfolio, and what makes your portfolio look good, it&#8217;s time we walk you through each step of creating an online portfolio from scratch.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you already have a website, then you can directly go to the 3rd step.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choosing a Domain Name and Web Hosting</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out, the first thing you&#8217;ll need is a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/difference-between-domain-name-and-web-hosting-revealed/\" title=\"What’s the Difference Between Domain Name and Web Hosting?

After purchasing your domain name, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to get associated email accounts with it. Using an email address branded with your domain name is a great way to give off professional vibe to your potential customers. You can even create multiple email accounts associated with your domain, so your team members can better represent your brand. </p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how to properly create email accounts for your domain name and use them to send emails.</p>\n<h3>Why Should You Create Email Accounts for Your Domain Name?</h3>\n<p>Most email addresses you&#8217;ll see end with gmail.com, live.com, aol.com, etc. These email addresses are great for personal use, but aren&#8217;t recommended for businesses, or anyone else looking to portray a professional image.</p>\n<p>First of all, if your name is relatively common, then you most likely won&#8217;t get your desired email address. You&#8217;ll end up adding numbers or additional letters to your email address (ex: dan.brown321@gmail.com) which doesn&#8217;t look professional. In fact, it looks downright spammy.</p>\n<p>If you have a business then you&#8217;ll need a simple email address that represents yourself and your company name.</p>\n<p>You can achieve that by creating email addresses for your domain name. Check out this example:</p>\n<p><strong>Your Domain Name:</strong></p>\n<p>www.example.com</p>\n<p><strong>Your Email Address:</strong></p>\n<p>dan.brown@example.com or dan@example.com</p>\n<p>From the above example, you can easily see the difference between a personal and a professional email address. Emails sent using your own domain name will quickly gain the trust of your users, and it&#8217;s a great way to conduct business-related communication.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up Email Accounts for Your Domain Name</h3>\n<p>To create business email accounts, you&#8217;ll need a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/difference-between-domain-name-and-web-hosting-revealed/\" title=\"What’s the Difference Between Domain Name and Web Hosting? (REVEALED)\">domain name and web hosting</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you already have a domain name and web hosting, then skip to the next step.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1. Register a Domain Name and Web Hosting</strong></p>\n<p>You can check out the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/choose-best-domain-name-registrar/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best Domain Name Registrar\">top domain name registrars</a> to purchase your professional business name online. Not only can you buy a domain name, but these registrars will also suggest other business name options.</p>\n<p>After getting your domain name, you&#8217;ll need to connect it with a web hosting account. You&#8217;ll need to do this before you can create email accounts for your domain name.</p>\n<p>We recommend using <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> for web hosting. It&#8217;s the most popular hosting company in the world.</p>\n<p>For IsItWP users, they&#8217;re offering a free domain name, a free SSL certificate, and a massive discount on web hosting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer-1.png\" alt=\"bluehost-register-domain-name-free\" width=\"740\" height=\"404\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228494\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer-1.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer-1-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have your domain name and web hosting, you&#8217;ll need to log into your Bluehost account to create your email accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2. Log Into Your Hosting cPanel and Create Your Email Accounts</strong></p>\n<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to log into your cPanel account. If you&#8217;re using Bluehost, then the cPanel will look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bluehost-cpanel.jpg\" alt=\"Bluehost cPanel\" width=\"774\" height=\"346\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230792\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bluehost-cpanel.jpg 774w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bluehost-cpanel-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bluehost-cpanel-768x343.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to click the &#8216;Email and Office&#8217; tab from the left-hand navigation menu and click on the &#8216;Manage&#8217; button to get started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-emails.jpg\" alt=\"Manage emails\" width=\"775\" height=\"334\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230793\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-emails.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-emails-300x129.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-emails-768x331.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>On the next page, you&#8217;ll find multiple tabs. Under the &#8216;Add Email Account&#8217; tab, you can enter your desired account name. Try something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dan@example.com</li>\n<li>info@example.com</li>\n<li>hello@example.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the above example, &#8216;dan,&#8217; &#8216;info,&#8217; and &#8216;hello&#8217; are the usernames and &#8216;example.com&#8217; is your business/domain name.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-email-accounts.jpg\" alt=\"Create email accounts\" width=\"775\" height=\"395\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230794\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-email-accounts.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-email-accounts-300x153.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-email-accounts-768x391.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Make sure that you don&#8217;t enter your domain name in this field as it&#8217;s already there. You don&#8217;t want to end up as &#8216;dan@example.com@example.com!&#8217;</p>\n<p>After choosing your account name, you can enter a secure password. If you can&#8217;t think of a secure enough password, Bluehost will offer to generate a random password for you which you can save before continuing.</p>\n<p>Next, you can add the Mailbox Quota. This quota depends on your hosting plan and we recommend you leave it as-is. By default, it&#8217;s set to 500 MB, which is a decent amount of space for an email account. You should have more than enough space; however, you can always increase or decrease it later, if needed.</p>\n<p>Click on the &#8216;Create Account&#8217; button to complete the process. You can make multiple email accounts for your domain name by repeating the above steps.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done, simply go to the &#8216;Email Accounts&#8217; tab to view all of the email addresses you created.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/email-accounts.jpg\" alt=\"Email accounts\" width=\"775\" height=\"306\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230795\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/email-accounts.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/email-accounts-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/email-accounts-768x303.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3. Access Your Email Account</strong></p>\n<p>To access your email accounts, you can click on the &#8216;Access Webmail&#8217; link next to an email address. It&#8217;ll open up an email client where you can see your new emails. You can also send emails from there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/access-webmail.jpg\" alt=\"Access webmail\" width=\"775\" height=\"380\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230796\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/access-webmail.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/access-webmail-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/access-webmail-768x377.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to set up your email account on other devices, like your mobile phone, then click on the &#8216;Connect Devices&#8217; link; and then click on the &#8216;Set Up Mail Client&#8217; option.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll display the information you need to configure your email account on all major applications/devices. Luckily, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> offers automatic configurations to many apps and devices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/setup-mail-clients.jpg\" alt=\"Set up email clients\" width=\"775\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230797\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/setup-mail-clients.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/setup-mail-clients-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/setup-mail-clients-768x446.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also find manual configuration options on that page for devices and applications that aren&#8217;t listed in the auto-config section.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up an Email Account with G Suite</h3>\n<p>Now that you have your email accounts, you can connect them with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/gsuite/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"G Suite\" rel=\"nofollow\">G Suite by Google Cloud</a> and use them from there. It&#8217;ll make your emailing experience a lot easier than using webmail by <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Should Connect Your Email Account with G Suite</strong></p>\n<p>The email clients offered by Bluehost, or any other web hosting company, are not as simple or tidy as Gmail. Also, you won&#8217;t get additional apps like you will with G Suite. Webmail is a simple application to send and receive emails with no other features.</p>\n<p>However, you may use G Suite daily on your laptop and phone. G Suite includes all the popular Google apps like Gmail, Google Photos, Docs, Drive, etc.</p>\n<p>Once you connect your business email accounts with G Suite, you can access all their apps and features.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a premium service which means you&#8217;ll need to pay an additional cost other than the cost of a domain name and web hosting, but it&#8217;s well worth the price. <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/gsuite/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"G Suite\" rel=\"nofollow\">G Suite</a> plans start from $5 per user / month. It&#8217;ll include resources separately for the number of accounts you purchase.</p>\n<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to go the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/gsuite/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"G Suite\" rel=\"nofollow\">G Suite</a> website and select a plan to get started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/selectplan.jpg\" alt=\"Select a plan\" width=\"775\" height=\"368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230828\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/selectplan.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/selectplan-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/selectplan-768x365.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>On the next page, you&#8217;ll need to enter basic details about your business to continue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/get-started-gsuite.jpg\" alt=\"Get started with G Suite\" width=\"775\" height=\"420\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230829\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/get-started-gsuite.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/get-started-gsuite-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/get-started-gsuite-768x416.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you&#8217;ll be asked if you have a domain name.

A good domain name is important to the success of your website or blog. After all, it’s how your audience will find you on the world wide web. So, it can’t be just a split second decision; you’ve got to spend time to come up with the best domain name possible. Plus, there are some domain name best practices you should know about to help you pick the right domain name for your website. </p>\n<p>Luckily, in this article we’re going to share some tips and tricks for how to pick the best domain name. Once you find the perfect domain name for your website, we’ll then show you <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-register-a-domain-name/\">how to register your domain name for free</a>! Let’s begin. </p>\n<h3>1. Brainstorm Ideas and Research</h3>\n<p>The first step to picking the best domain name is to brainstorm some ideas and do some research. If you’re thinking about how to choose a domain name for your blog or website, then you’ve probably been thinking about <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">starting a blog</a> or a business for awhile. So, you should have some ideas about what you want your blog to be about or what your business is going to be. Which is important to choosing the best domain name because your domain name should relate to your business and your brand. </p>\n<p>Start with a domain name generator tool to help you come up with some ideas. Try out the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/domain-name-generator/\">IsItWP Free Domain Name Generator</a>. Just enter in 1 or 2 keywords for your business or blog. For instance, if you want to start a website for an accounting business, try typing in the keyword &#8220;accounting&#8221;. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/isitwp-domain-generator1.jpg\" alt=\"isitwp-domain-name-generator\" width=\"740\" height=\"329\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228481\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/isitwp-domain-generator1.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/isitwp-domain-generator1-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>After you enter in the keyword, press the Generate Names button. The generator will then provide you with numerous domain name ideas that include your keyword. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/isitwp-domain-generator2.jpg\" alt=\"domain-name-ideas-generator\" width=\"740\" height=\"464\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228482\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/isitwp-domain-generator2.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/isitwp-domain-generator2-300x188.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>With a domain name generator like this one, you’ll be able to brainstorm a ton of great domain name ideas for your website.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget that if you already have a domain name idea in mind, that you’ll need to do research to make sure it’s not already taken by someone else. </p>\n<h3>2. Pick the Right Domain Extension</h3>\n<p>When choosing a domain name for your blog or website, you also need to pick the right domain extension. A domain extension, which is also known as a Top Level Domain or TLD, is simply the suffix or the last part of a domain name. For example, with the domain name www.Google.com, .com is the domain extension. There are a number of different domain extensions that are used today, the most common ones include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>.com (commercial)</strong> &#8211; This is the most popular domain extension on the internet. It was originally created for commercial businesses but now it can be used for anything.</li>\n<li><strong>.biz (business)</strong> &#8211; This domain extension was created primarily for businesses whose preferred domain names were already taken with .com.</li>\n<li><strong>.org (organization)</strong> &#8211; Originally created for <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-themes-non-profits-charity-websites/\">non-profit organizations and charity websites</a> but now this domain name can be used by anyone.</li>\n<li><strong>.net (network)</strong> &#8211; An alternative to the popular .com domain extension that anyone can use, but originally created for network infrastructure use.</li>\n<li><strong>.edu (education)</strong> &#8211; This domain extension can only be used by accredited higher learning institutions like universities for instance.</li>\n<li><strong>.gov (government)</strong> &#8211; This domain extension can only be used by government entities.</li>\n<li><strong>Country specific</strong> &#8211; There are also domain extensions for specific countries like .ca for Canada and .in for India.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend that you stick with .com for your domain extension because it’s the most credible and established domain extension. Plus, since .com is so synonymous with the internet, many users type in .com by default because they’re so used to it. For instance, if your domain name is AccountingByJudy.net, many users will instead type the more memorable domain extension .com without even thinking about it and won’t be able to find your website. This is especially common for users who aren’t tech-savvy. </p>\n<p>You want your website to be as easy to find as possible and to also appear credible, which is why we recommend choosing the .com domain extension. </p>\n<h3>3. Use Keywords</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/keywords.png\" alt=\"keywords\" width=\"740\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231369\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/keywords.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/keywords-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/keyword-research-101-how-to-choose-the-right-terms-for-google/\" target=\"_blank\">Using keywords</a> is an important part in picking the best domain name. Keywords are how search engines can tell what your website is about. When someone searches for your keyword on the internet, if you include the keyword in your domain name, your website has a better chance of showing up near the top of search results. </p>\n<p>For example, if a user searches for photography services on Google, and your domain name is PreciousPhotography.com, your website is more likely to show up in their search results. Whereas if you don’t include keywords in your domain name and choose instead something like PreciousSnaps.com, your website may not show up in any search results for photography. It can be difficult to find a domain name that’s available for top keywords like “photography” but you just have to be creative and mix the keyword with other unique words to find the perfect combination. </p>\n<h3>4. Target Local Keywords</h3>\n<p>Regarding keywords, if you have a local business that’s focusing on a particular geographic area, you should target local keywords in your domain name as well. When users are searching for a business or service in their area, they typically add their city or state to the search to get results that are near them. For example, “landscaping Phoenix”. </p>\n<p>So, if you want to show up in local search results, add a local keyword to your domain name. Instead of BobsLandscaping.com, use BobsLandscapingPhoenix.com so that your website will show up in local search results. </p>\n<h3>5. Make it Easy to Type and Understand</h3>\n<p>When choosing a domain name, you might be tempted to come up a totally unique spelling to make your domain name stand out or change the spelling of a word because someone else took your preferred domain name. But, you should avoid picking a domain name that is too difficult for users to understand and type. </p>\n<p>If you change the spelling of a word in your domain name, for example, taking a domain name like ProfessionalPainting.com and turning it into ProfssnlPaintng.com, it will be more difficult for users to find your website. Try to avoid double letters as well. For example, a domain name like Glassstatues.com is likely to be typed incorrectly by users. Keep it simple and easy to type. </p>\n<h3>6. Keep it Short</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/easy-to-remember-domain-name.png\" alt=\"easy to remember domain name\" width=\"740\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231368\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/easy-to-remember-domain-name.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/easy-to-remember-domain-name-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Nobody wants to type in a domain name that’s 64 characters long. Not only is it annoying for users, but it also increases the chances of misspellings that result in your website not being found and a loss of traffic. </p>\n<p>It’s much better to have a domain name that’s short and easy to remember. We recommend you keep your domain name under 15 characters long. </p>\n<h3>7. Avoid Numbers and Hyphens</h3>\n<p>You should avoid using numbers and hyphens in your domain name too. Numbers are often confusing for people because if you tell them “5” they might take it as “five”, which can lead to misspellings of your domain name. If you do need a number in your domain name because it’s in your business name for instance, you can register both variations to avoid this problem. </p>\n<p>You’ll want to avoid hyphens altogether as well because hyphens are often associated with spam domains and you don’t want people to think <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-security-plugins-compared/\">your website isn&#8217;t safe</a>. Hyphens also lead to misspellings because many users will forget to add a hyphen when typing your domain. </p>\n<h3>8. Don&#8217;t Be Generic &#8211; Be Unique</h3>\n<p>There are millions of registered domain names, so you have to make sure your domain name is unique and memorable. A domain name isn’t just your online address, it’s also part of your brand. So, while being easy to understand is important, it also has to be appealing and it has to represent who you are.  </p>\n<p>For example insurance.com is generic and boring, and it’s also probably already taken by someone. But a domain name like GuardedInsurance.com is unique and memorable, and it says to your potential customers that you’re a trustworthy company. Make sure your domain name will stand out in the minds of your website visitors.</p>\n<h3>9. Don&#8217;t Pigeonhole Yourself</h3>\n<p>When coming up with a unique domain name, it’s important not to pigeonhole yourself either. Picking a domain name that puts you in a box and only allows your business to be associated with one specific thing will present problems for you in the future when you want to grow and expand your business. </p>\n<p>Picture this: You start a business making handmade ceramic ornaments and choose your domain name to be CeramicOrnaments.com. In the future however, you want to start making other things like mugs, plates, bowls, etc. Consumers who are interested in those kitchenware items might pass over or never even discover your website because of its limited domain name. Pick a domain name that will give you room to grow. </p>\n<h3>Bonus Tip: Register your Domain Name for Free</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve picked the best domain name, you need to register your domain name in order to protect it from being taken by someone else.

The app helps users challenge their &#8220;automatic thoughts,&#8221; a term that refers to thoughts that come to a person spontaneously in response to a trigger, which can often be negative.</p>\n<p>Quirk lets users record a quick thought and will automatically narrow down a list of potential ways these thoughts are distorted. The distortions were inspired by the ones popularized in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UW5X4C/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy</a>. The user is then invited to challenge those distortions and write an alternative thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cZMMRywMDBL\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/5f9Qce5NQW.gif?resize=627%2C667&ssl=1\" alt=\"Quirk demo\" width=\"627\" height=\"667\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Conrad</a>, a software engineer at Segment, created Quirk as a non-commercial, personal project to make it easy for people to take control of their irrational thoughts using a common CBT technique. Quirk is not a substitute for a trained therapist but rather a tool for people to use on their own. Left unchecked, negative automatic thoughts can become emotional weights and lead to distorted thinking. Quirk is a simple app that helps people experience the world in a less negative way and develop more rational thinking patterns. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s super useful for day-to-day stuff,&#8221; Conrad said in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589700\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to comments on Hacker News. &#8220;Take a thought like &#8216;<em>I took too many hints in that interview question</em>.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That thought might lead to <em>&#8216;I must have failed that interview,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll fail all the rest of my interviews,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll never get another job,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I must be really bad at this, I should just give up.&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Each step seemed kind of logical at the time, but one thought led to the next and now you feel awful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CBT is a counter measure to this; it stops you at that first point and gives you a bunch of common logical fallacies that help you recognize why your thought is overreaching. You don’t know if you really flunked that interview, besides flunking one is good practice to pass the next one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad said these types of thought processes aren&#8217;t exactly a mental health issue but are common struggles for many people. Quirk can be a useful tool for anyone looking to recognize and remove their own cognitive biases.</p>\n<p>The iOS version of the app currently works better than the Android one, as the author said he doesn&#8217;t have an Android phone and finds it difficult to support the app on that platform. However, fixes are being pushed out regularly and many of the issues with crashing are getting resolved.</p>\n<h3>How the GPL Protects Users in Mental Health Tech</h3>\n<p>The code for Quirk can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and is open source under the GPL-3.0, which is not a popular choice for licensing mobile apps. I asked Conrad why he opted for the GPL license, as opposed to other popular open source licenses. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Mental Health tech is a really weird world,&#8221; Conrad said. &#8220;There’s a lot of folks who want to do the right thing, but end up doing really sketchy stuff. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, a lot of apps collect the thoughts you’re recording for ML (Machine Learning) or NLP (Natural Language Processing). The stated purpose of this is to help better identify suicide, depression, etc. Partially because of the subject matter, many apps aren’t clearly telling their users that this is happening.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So what ends up happening is a bunch of well intended researchers get access to your most sensitive thoughts. Which is fine, but they frequently aren’t aware of how valuable of a target they’re holding to a nefarious actor. Because it’s not like a database of passwords or credit card numbers, they tend to not think about security. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But thoughts are super valuable and dangerous for abusers and blackmailers; plus most people would rather give you their password in plaintext than show you their mental health thoughts. </p>\n<p>&#8220;So if I made Quirk MIT, I would worry that someone would take Quirk and launch their own version for research that tracks and stores user thoughts. Because the license doesn’t follow them, they could do it without telling a user and there would be little way for an average person to /know/ that this is happening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad has taken an inspiring, user-centric approach to licensing and privacy that ensures users of his app (and any derivatives) will have access to the code and a better understanding of where their data is being stored. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1114575448485191681\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, he outlined the privacy principles that underpin Quirk&#8217;s architecture:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Quirk, FOSS and privacy isn&#8217;t a focus, it&#8217;s a given. Outside the tech world, Quirk is not trying to be a FOSS CBT app, it&#8217;s trying to be a really good CBT app that happens to be FOSS. It&#8217;s not coming out and saying &#8220;hey we don&#8217;t store your deepest darkest secrets on some server somewhere.&#8221; User&#8217;s don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s a given. It doesn&#8217;t store things on the device because it&#8217;s trying to sell you on privacy, it does it because it&#8217;s the correct engineering decision. </p>\n<p>Regular people don&#8217;t look at the Golden Gate bridge and think about the structural quality of the bolts. They pull out their phones and take a picture. The responsibility of software is to make things frictionless and reduce the stuff someone has to think about before buying in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Conrad said he would like to see other developers build things using the app and conduct research, as long as they do so ethically. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a> has a detailed writeup of its design and engineering logic. It includes specific goals the code was built around in order to respect users&#8217; privacy and mental health, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Thoughts are more valuable than passwords, treat them that way.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Be extremely cautious about making engagement your core metric.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>But be clear and obvious within the app about what&#8217;s going on with the user&#8217;s data.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I really do want to see people use Quirk for research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just want it to follow more ethical practices of consent and data security. Someone should willingly give a researcher their thoughts and as little information should be given about the person as possible. When it’s stored, it should be stored safely and not on a publicly exposed DB for example. But for that to happen, it has to be open.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond GPL-specific licensing, making the app open source has many other benefits. Quirk has already been translated into six different languages. One of the byproducts of making a useful app open source is that it energizes contributors and speeds up the process of bringing the app to new audiences. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I cannot express how absolutely amazing it is that Quirk was translated into 6 languages in just a few days. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"🔥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2665.png\" alt=\"♥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan Conrad (@flaqueEau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1115843899594084352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feedback on the app so far has been mostly positive. One commenter on Hacker News <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589889\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thanked</a> Conrad for open sourcing the app because he wasn&#8217;t able to continue in-person CBT due to the cost:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been through CBT and stopped because of the cost. I feel that an app like this can complement those of us that have had face to face time but stopped for whatever reason.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Quirk is an inspiring example of how open source software can help people with every day problems. Its carefully-considered implementation respects users&#8217; sensitive information and doesn&#8217;t encourage an unhealthy attachment to the app. </p>\n<p>If you like Quirk and want to contribute, you can find the app on <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\">GitHub</a>, including directions for <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk/issues/42#issuecomment-480547963\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">translating it into different languages</a>.

Creator and maintainer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonbahl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Bahl</a> put the project up on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wp-graphql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> last week after people frequently asked how the community can support the project. WPGraphQL already has five backers, an $800 balance, and an estimated annual budget of $2,687.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Large well-known sites such as <a href=\"http://qz.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">qz.com</a> and <a href=\"http://theplayerstribune.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theplayerstribune.com</a> are in production with JavaScript front-ends that consume data from WordPress via WPGraphQL,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;PostLight Studio maintains a popular &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headless WP Starter</a>&#8221; project that initially started as a React + REST API boilerplate, but recently added WPGraphQL support as well.&#8221; </p>\n<p>One of the most important signs of the project&#8217;s growth are the extensions that developers are building on top of it, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ashhitch/wp-graphql-yoast-seo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Yoast SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pristas-peter/wp-graphql-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Gutenberg</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Quartz/wp-graphql-content-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Content Blocks</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields</a> is getting very close to an initial release and Caldera Forms is also <a href=\"https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues/3149\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exploring integrations with WPGraphQL</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The two most-searched things on <a href=\"http://WPGraphQL.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL.com</a> are &#8220;Advanced Custom Fields&#8221; and &#8220;WooCommerce,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;People are interested in using WPGraphQL with other popular WordPress projects, and WPGraphQL for WooCommerce is a reaction to the folks that are already looking for alternatives to the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WPGraphQL for WooCommerce Seeks $15K in Funding</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for WooCommerce</a> is an extension created by Geoffry Taylor that has started to gain some traction. Taylor is a core contributor to the main WPGraphQL plugin. He has just published <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kidunot89/wpgraphql-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Kickstarter to help fund development</a> of the extension and Bahl is consulting with him on implementation details and code reviews. </p>\n<p>Taylor began contributing to the WPGraphQL project last year after discovering the repository and finding that it lacked the features he needed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I was looking for a solution that would allow me to create React-Apollo JS apps that could be used as WordPress themes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the solution couldn&#8217;t rely on a node server, because a large portion of my clients use shared hosting. WPGraphQL was a perfect fit for what I needed, but it lacked the features I needed at the time. This led to me contributing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since then Taylor has also created other libraries and tools that work directly or indirectly with WPGraphQL, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-composer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Composer</a>, a React-Apollo component library, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/oil-based-boilerplate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oil-Based Boilerplate</a>, a boilerplate for developing React-powered WordPress themes, plugins, and guten-blocks that use shared components.</p>\n<p>Taylor is seeking $15K in funding for development of the WPGraphQL WooCommerce extension, which would enable him to apply 100% of his time to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The question I think a lot of people have, is what does this extension provide that WPGraphQL and WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t already?&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;It adds WooCommerce support to the WPGraphQL server. It is being designed to match and increase the functionality of WooCommerce REST to make it as easy as possible to convert your app from the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor said the extension is past the initial explorations and is well into development. If a developer follows the instructions in the README they will be able to query products and their variations, coupons, orders, refunds, customer information, and (after the next update), order items from the WPGraphQL endpoint. He said that with the exception of products, none of the data is queryable for any user without shop-manager level capabilities. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Customer-level functionality is the target goal right now, meaning customers can register/login, update the cart, and checkout,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested can follow the project&#8217;s progress on <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> or get involved on Slack at <a href=\"http://wp-graphql.slack.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wp-graphql.slack.com</a> in the #woocommerce channel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:49:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordSesh Returns May 22, 2019, Speaker Application Deadline is April 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-returns-may-22-2019-speaker-application-deadline-is-april-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1978:\"<p>The next edition of <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordSesh</a> is scheduled for Wednesday, May 22, 2019, from 10am-8pm EDT (UTC-4) &#8211; just a little over one month away.

Some even felt blindsided by the original implementation. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Last week, the release candidate was running on my staging server, and out of nowhere, I noticed these ads being inserted inline with the rest of the WC admin list tables,&#8221; Tobin Fekkes said. &#8220;What a shock that was! I thought I’d developed a bad case of malware or something. What nasty plugin was corrupting my core, default products table, order table, etc?! Oh, just core WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have never once gone looking to add a plugin to my site by starting at the &#8216;Products&#8217; tab. Because it doesn’t belong there. If I want to install an extension or plugin, I will go to the (aptly named) &#8216;Extensions&#8217; tab or “Plugins” tab.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is rather telling that we as longtime developers who attend every Dev chat, bookmark and check this Dev blog daily, and test all your betas and release candidates STILL had no idea about this blatant abuse of trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce, addressed the issue of marketplace suggestions seeming to come out of nowhere in a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-6-to-add-marketplace-suggestions-despite-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-from-developer-community#comment-285682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on our recent post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are committed to working with our community, including the plugin review team, and responding to feedback. Just as a reminder, the Marketplace Suggestions feature was developed in the open in a long-running feature branch/PR which was merged to master a month ago. It was mentioned in the Beta 1 Release notes, and was testable during Beta1 and prior on master.</p>\n<p>It is often only when the release candidate comes out that we get certain kinds of feedback. It’s an important stage in the development cycle when we want and expect input. With the 3.6 RC1 live, we received specific feedback that we could take into consideration and act on. Thanks to the developers, end users, and the plugin review team for all their help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.6 RC2 doesn&#8217;t make any changes to the frequency with which users will need to dismiss the ads.

I knew that I hadn’t been asleep long because we’d already run a late call and it was still dark outside. Running to the truck, I hear the address come out over the radio for a medical call. It’s the third time this week we’ve been called to the same house.</p>\n<p>My driving is on autopilot because I know the city streets like the back of my hand. Not only had I worked in the same fire department for the last 6 years, but I’d also grown up in this city. On this and many other times I’d been woken up in the middle of the night, I’m starting to realize that I’m losing my passion for the job I once loved.</p>\n<h3>How I Got Into Firefighting</h3>\n<p>At 19 years old I was working in fast food, and I knew I needed to do something more with my life. I wasn’t really keen on going to college just yet, so I started looking for jobs that only needed vocational school. Knowing that I wouldn’t be a very good police officer, I signed up for fire school.</p>\n<p>During fire school I found the only way to get a job as a firefighter in Florida was to also be an EMT in order to run medical calls, so I enrolled in there as well. While I was in school, one of the instructors I met told me their department was taking on volunteers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Six years in the field, a year of paramedic school, and many sleepless nights later, I’m driving to a call feeling trapped in a career that I don’t care for anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the perks of being a firefighter is that in between calls the free time is ours to do what we like, we just need to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice. Some of the time we watch movies and play video games, but I wanted that time to do something productive that I could turn into an opportunity for a side gig.</p>\n<h3>Why I Chose Web Developer</h3>\n<p>I stumbled across a YouTube video that demonstrated how to create a webpage with HTML. I loaded a page that stereotypically read “Hello World” and I was hooked. I didn’t even own a computer at this time in my life, but my wife had a MacBook Air. She was nice enough to let me borrow it so I could keep learning. Downloading a text editor, I started creating web pages and loading them up in a browser. Though, as I was creating these pages, it was pretty obvious there weren&#8217;t any live websites out there that looked as bad as what I was creating.</p>\n<p>While going through YouTube looking for more tutorials, I kept seeing videos for this thing called WordPress in the sidebar. Curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on one of the videos. I saw how pages were being created from an admin background and how themes changed the look of sites, while plugins added functionality. I was completely blown away.</p>\n<p>By this time, I had purchased a $250 Chromebook I was running Linux from, and I decided that I was going to run a local development environment on this little computer with a 16GB hard drive. I managed to succeed, and with each accomplishment I had, I found that I was becoming extremely passionate about building these little websites.</p>\n<h3>Meeting Other Humans</h3>\n<p>I knew that I wasn’t going to make it very far past the beginning stages without help from someone other than a search engine. Though without any knowledge of the community and how they would act towards me, going to a local meetup was something that made me very uncomfortable. I thought the second they caught a glimpse of my Chromebook and my silly beginner questions they’d have me out the door before I could sit down.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even in the parking lot before my first meetup, I was sitting in my car telling myself that I should just drive home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I walked into the meetup I was surprised to find people in all stages of their growth with WordPress. There were even people that knew less than me, and they were accepted just as much as I was. It was there I learned about this event called a WordCamp. I knew that whatever it was, I needed to be there and it was only two months away.</p>\n<h3>First WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Sitting in my car in front of my first WordCamp Orlando, I felt the same feelings that I did before my first meetup. I reminded myself how welcoming the meetup was, and that this wasn’t going to be any different. When I grabbed my seat in the main auditorium, I started feeling pretty strongly that I was alone in a room of 300 people. There were business owners that could actually make money off WordPress, and it felt that there weren’t many people at my experience level. As I went from talk to talk, the topics flew over my head and I became very overwhelmed. I told myself that I was going to stick it out till lunch and that I could go home after if I wanted.</p>\n<p>Lunch came and as I was walking around looking for a good place to sit, I noticed a familiar face sitting at a table with no one next to him. Up until now, I had been learning exclusively at Lynda.com and Treehouse. I was learning to use the Genesis Framework and took a couple courses by an instructor named <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/freed-from-the-soil-lab/\">Jesse Petersen</a>, and this guy looked just like him. Walking up next to him I said: “I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but you look just like an instructor I learned from on Treehouse.” He laughed and said that he was indeed that instructor from Treehouse.</p>\n<p>The pitch of my voice shot up an octave, and I started fanning out over how I had learned so much from him and asked if I could eat with him. While we ate, I told him that I was a firefighter and how I also wanted to become a web developer and build websites. By the end of the lunch, he told me that he saw something in me and that he wanted to mentor me if I was ok with that. Was I ok with that?!? Of course, I was ok with that! I was doing my best to sound cool all the while I’m absolutely ecstatic on the inside.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day I followed him around to talks, and while I was listening, he was setting up my computer with tools to help get me set up for further development. He added me to his Slack channel and told me that we were going to be working together remotely. When the day finished he asked me where we were having dinner in between the last session and the after-party.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve never gone from feeling so out of place somewhere to then feeling so welcomed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was talking to a person that had absolutely no gain from helping me out, yet spent the entirety of his day getting me set up to work with him in the future.</p>\n<p>Jesse wasn’t feeling well the next day due to an illness he had called Cystic Fibrosis. He said that he would keep up with me through the day on Slack though. Whenever I felt like I didn’t belong I would look at the tools Jesse had installed on my computer and the Slack channel and would remember that I was welcome. I was going to be learning some awesome stuff, and now I had a mentor.</p>\n<h3>Gettin&#8217; Paid</h3>\n<p>I spent the next few months going to two other WordCamps learning as much as I could and meeting as many people as possible. After going down to WordCamp Miami, I got approached by a local agency owner at a meetup that had some extra work I could help out with. Little did I know, they were also friends with Jesse and he had told them about me and what I’d been learning. This gave me a chance to get my feet wet and build some very strong friendships with some amazing people. I was now making money doing what I loved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four months later I got a Slack message from one of my friends telling me that Jesse had passed away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was on shift at the fire department that day, and I felt like someone had hit me with a bat. He was due to get new lungs any time, and just the day before was telling me how he was going to start a new life once he had the strength of new lungs to do so. We were all crushed to hear of his passing. I knew it was going to be hard moving forward without him, but I knew that’s what he would have wanted.</p>\n<h3>Keynote Presentation</h3>\n<p>I continued working on my skills until I was asked to do a keynote presentation at WordCamp Orlando. The very WordCamp I’d thought about leaving halfway through just a year before. The owner of the agency I was working for, Chris Edwards, told me they’d had a speaker back out and they needed someone to fill in, so they asked <i>me</i>. They wanted me to tell my story of how I had gotten into the WordPress community. I agreed, believing it was only going to a small room full of people, but when I said yes, I was then told I would be giving the opening keynote address in front of the entire WordCamp. I had already said yes, so now there was no way that I could back down and tell him no.</p>\n<p>As I was standing on stage waiting to be introduced, I was relieved to find there was a podium. Now no one could see my legs shaking as I stood there for an hour. I could now put all my focus on making sure the hand holding the microphone stayed steady. My talk was on the past year that had led me to this point and all of the fears and vulnerabilities I’d faced. If there was someone that was feeling the way I had a year ago, I wanted them to know that they were welcome and I was excited to have them there.</p>\n<h3>Leaving the Fire Service</h3>\n<p>The rest of the weekend passed, and I got a message from my friend Chris Edwards telling me that a company that makes a donation plugin called Give was looking for a support technician. Matt Cromwell, who was about to be my new boss, was sitting in the audience while I gave my keynote presentation. I filled out the application and got a response back that he wanted to set up an interview.</p>\n<p>A year has passed since that time, and I’ve grown so much in my knowledge of web development, website management, and WordPress. I’ve just started my first business as a freelance WordPress developer, and again I’m feeling the same fears, excitement, and vulnerabilities I felt every time I started to push myself. It’s now to the point where I almost keep a lookout for the fear because I know that something amazing is going to happen on the other side.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m always going to remember the compassion that Jesse Petersen had for me, and remember to pay that kindness forward in helping others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s no way I could have planned this path for myself even if I’d tried. I know that I’m in the right place now, because every day I wake up I’m happy that I get to work with WordPress and interact with this awesome community. I wouldn’t be anything without the help of those around me, and I will always be grateful for everything they’ve done.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Firefighter to Web Developer\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Firefighter%20to%20Web%20Developer&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Firefighter to Web Developer\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F&title=Firefighter+to+Web+Developer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041019-min-150x150.jpg&description=Firefighter to Web Developer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/\" title=\"Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/\">Firefighter to Web Developer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 12:00:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Sam Smith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: GoDaddy Acquires ThemeBeans, CoBlocks, Block Gallery, and Block Unit Tests\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4970:\"<p>GoDaddy has acquired <a href=\"https://coblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a>, <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeBeans</a>, <a href=\"https://wpblockgallery.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Gallery</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-unit-test\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Unit Tests</a>, one of the leading Gutenberg product lines in the WordPress ecosystem. Founder Rich Tabor is joining GoDaddy as Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience and will lead a team dedicated to understanding users&#8217; needs and expanding the company&#8217;s Gutenberg-related products. Tabor&#8217;s fellow CoBlocks founders Jeffrey Carandang and Alex Denning will not be joining GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>All the commercial themes in the ThemeBeans catalog are now available for free on <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. Current customers will continue to receive theme support and remote updates until April 8, 2020. </p>\n<p>According to Aaron Campbell, GoDaddy&#8217;s head of WordPress Ecosystem &#038; Community, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> will continue to be freely available on WordPress.org. It currently has more than 3,000 active installations and averages a 4.7-star rating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing will change with the plugin except that it will be added to the GoDaddy account on .org,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible it might be renamed or rebranded in the future, but that&#8217;s unknown either way at this point. And yes, it will still be on the WordPress.org directory for everyone not just GoDaddy customers (and we plan to add more to it as we develop new blocks).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell could not yet share a roadmap for the plugin as Tabor just started and will be heavily involved in determining the plugin&#8217;s future at GoDaddy. Tabor will also be leading a development team that is bringing on more React talent to assist with Gutenberg tasks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hiring React devs that are capable with Gutenberg is a newer thing that we&#8217;re really not totally sure whether it&#8217;ll be difficult or not or even how it&#8217;ll look,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;Do you hire WordPress people? React people? Only those that do both? Do you hire both and pair them up to learn from each other? It&#8217;s a thing we&#8217;re learning in this new post-Gutenberg world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he was surprised that his products had attracted GoDaddy&#8217;s interest but also found it to be validating of his own efforts and the potential of the block editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Throughout my time building themes, and then blocks, I’ve learned the real value of getting eyes on a project: Not only do you get the community rallying behind your ideas, such as the Block Manager recently added in Gutenberg 5.3, but you receive a TON of feedback and inspiration,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;Building on that feedback, consistently delivering clever ideas, and executing on the marketing front with inspiring videos, has landed us in a very opportune position.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy has acquired a handful of WordPress companies and services during the past few years (ManageWP, Sucuri, WP Curve), but Tabor&#8217;s products are the first Gutenberg-related acquisition for the company. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it means that the WordPress ecosystem is important, that it’s maturing, and probably most of all &#8211; that it’s moving and changing,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I think all of those are good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has changed a lot in WordPress. It’s not just a new editor or new interface, it’s a whole new system that brings with it a whole new group of challenges. Companies like GoDaddy recognizing this and supporting innovation is a healthy sign of growth and maturity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s resources will enable CoBlocks, ThemeBeans, and Block Gallery to move faster and add features that were previously out of reach for Tabor&#8217;s small team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ll go from just two developers, to a team of incredibly bright engineers,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I won’t be spending time figuring out all the intricacies of monetizing a premium plugin in today’s ever-changing WordPress ecosystem. Instead, I can focus on leading the team’s efforts on bringing a better page building experience to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He will also have access to insights and data that will enable his team to make more informed decisions about the tools and blocks they build.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This view into how entrepreneurs and business owners are using WordPress is something I could never have achieved at a meaningful scale, and I know it will help me move more confidently in the future landscape of Gutenberg,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 04:15:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6874\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3882:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

This is one of the goals on the roadmap Matt Mullenweg outlined in his <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9 Projects for 2019</a> post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-07-at-9.55.15-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Based on the requirements outlined in the beginning of the document, it looks like the Gutenberg team is working to make the transition from widgets to blocks as seamless as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing blocks in wp-admin/widgets.php and the wp-admin/customize.php should use the same block editor that wp-admin/post-new.php uses.</li>\n<li>The block editor should read and update blocks in widget-editing areas via the REST API.</li>\n<li>Upgrading WordPress must not affect the appearance of the user&#8217;s site, or any of their existing widgets.</li>\n<li>Existing Core and third-party widgets must remain functional in the new block-based interface.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility must be maintained. That is, themes and plugins that use public widget APIs must remain functional.</li>\n<li>During a transition period, it should be possible to disable the block-based interface and return to the classic widget-editing interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The requirements for backwards compatibility are a tall order but will make it much easier for users to trust WordPress during this transition. Content will not be forced into the new interface and users will retain the option to use the classic widget-editing screen if they prefer. The team has not yet announced a date for when widgets will be officially deprecated. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-3rd-april/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg version 5.4</a> was released last week with vertical alignment support for the columns block, a playsInline option in the video block, and a number of other minor enhancements.

When users search for a plugin that matches a term for an existing Jetpack feature, the plugin now inserts an artificial, dismissible search result into the first plugin card slot, identifying the corresponding Jetpack feature. </p>\n<p>The Jetpack team said users have a hard time knowing what features are available, with 45 modules packaged into the plugin. The idea behind the proof of concept for the suggestions was to improve the discoverability of Jetpack&#8217;s existing features. Many in the developer community became outraged after it was discovered that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack was also advertising paid upgrades</a> in this space as well. </p>\n<p>The fact that it was rolled out with promotions for paid upgrades made it seem to many onlookers that the discoverability problem was just a pretext for injecting advertising. The WordPress Plugin Team also said it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may or may not be a violation of the plugin directory guidelines</a> but that the team was still &#8220;arguing about the semantics internally.&#8221;  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/04/04/jetpack-7-2-1-maintenance-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 7.2.1</a> was released today, removing all feature suggestions that previously advertised upgrades.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made a mistake, and we’re moving to correct it immediately,&#8221; Jetpack team representative Jesse Friedman said.  &#8220;Our intention with these feature hints is to help you discover helpful features of Jetpack that you already have, right when you need them most. Today we’re correcting an error in judgement that resulted in the hints suggesting Jetpack features that actually required an upgrade.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Characterizing the mistake as &#8220;an error in judgment&#8221; is an admission that rolling out feature suggestions with paid upgrades was a conscious decision. One month later, the Jetpack team decided it was a poor choice. This appears to have be driven by the community&#8217;s reaction, but Jetpack did not elaborate on how or why they reached the decision to revert the promotions for paid upgrades.</p>\n<h3>Jetpack 7.2.1 Updates Design for &#8220;Hints,&#8221; Plans to Adopt WordPress Core Solution in the Future</h3>\n<p>The 7.2.1 maintenance release also changes the design for the feature suggestions, which they are now referring to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/feature-hints/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feature Hints</a>.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re reducing confusion around feature hints by simplifying the design and changing some text; this way it’s clear that feature hints are from Jetpack and are easily dismissible,&#8221; Friedman said.</p>\n<p>After updating to the latest release, you can see the revised design on the plugin search screen with new text: &#8220;This suggestion was made by Jetpack, the security and performance plugin already installed on your site.&#8221; Jetpack will disable the hints once administrators have dismissed three hints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.30.07-AM-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Going forward we want to help create a feature hints solution that works for all WordPress users and plugin developers,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;We are excited to work with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggestions like this one</a>, by Joost de Valk, and see how we might be able to find a solution in WordPress core to help users discover plugin features, and prevent this very common issue.

In a comment on an issue titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/23198\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rethinking 3.6&#8217;s Dashboard Ads</a>,&#8221; Josh Kohlbach contends that WooCommerce should limit its marketing to the plugin&#8217;s dedicated Extensions screen in the dashboard: </p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition, didn&#8217;t anyone think it might be a conflict of interest for WooCommerce the commercial entity to use WooCommerce the open source plugin to show ads in this manner? Bit anti-competitive to all the 3rd party devs out there (of which there are a lot).</p>\n<p>WooCommerce already has an amazing page under WooCommerce->Extensions with full searching capabilities etc. Why would you want to show irrelevant ads during a user&#8217;s everyday workflow?! Store owners use these screen daily, it&#8217;s terrible UX.</p>\n<p>I suggest that it gets ripped out in its entirety and filed under &#8220;cool implementation/fun to code but horrible idea for actual users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those who do not stand to benefit from profits from the 400+ extensions on the WooCommerce.com marketplace, the intrusions in the product admins screen seem all the more offensive. Marketplace suggestions have not been well-received by third-party extension developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is in direct competition to every third-party developer that is not selling on WooCommerce’s marketplace,&#8221; Jamie Madden, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.wcvendors.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WC Vendors Marketplace</a>, said. &#8220;I am one of these. This is advertising for your commercial products, no matter how you try and wrap this. You have an extensions page already which is more than enough, but advertising your products every 24 hours is going too far. This is completely unacceptable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The general consensus of those participating in the ticket is that injecting ads into product management screens will create a disruption to store managers&#8217; workflow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I too am very concerned about this,&#8221; digital agency owner <a href=\"https://www.bernskioldmedia.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Erik Bernskiold</a> said. &#8220;I get that WooCommerce want to benefit from their commercial side, too, and there are many ways to do this. But in this case, it feels like this is at a great disregard for the users. Hijacking a product list, order list or a user interface element in this way is a major interruption of the user experience. It&#8217;s not the place for an ad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion have suggested that WooCommerce make it an opt-in toggle in the settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only one scenario where I think this feature should stay in place and could be beneficial: If this feature is controlled by an opt-in toggle in WC settings,&#8221; <a href=\"http://jeremypry.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Pry</a> said. &#8220;Otherwise, this whole feature should be removed entirely. Store owners don&#8217;t need advertisements in their admin dashboard. In my opinion, leaving this feature in place would be very harmful to the WooCommerce community.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Marketplace Suggestions Require Dismissal Every Day for 5 Days, Only to Return 1 Month Later</h3>\n<p>The fact that the suggestions cannot actually be dismissed for good is one issue that developers predict will end up aggravating WooCommerce users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dismissing just to keep hounding the user, that&#8217;s not dismissing&#8230; that is snoozing,&#8221; WordPress developer <a href=\"https://mindsize.me/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Garman</a> said. &#8220;Because I told you 5 times that I don&#8217;t want to see your ads, that doesn&#8217;t mean come back in a month. The average user shouldn&#8217;t have to use a filter to make ads go away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up dialing back the frequency of the ads after they are closed, given that nearly all those participating in the conversation consider it unacceptable to require dismissal five days in a row, with the same process repeated every month thereafter. The frequency with which they are displayed is unusually aggressive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t think it technically violates the guidelines it’s just obnoxious and makes WooCommerce look like a low rent solution,&#8221; Astoundify founder <a href=\"http://www.astoundify.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Pickering</a> said. &#8220;It seems we are in a midst of a monetization push and they are looking for any where they can add up sells. Apparently doing so gracefully has gone out the window.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the overwhelmingly negative feedback, WooCommerce appears to be ploughing forward on its plan to ramp up its marketing in the admin. Automattic is a business and it needs to make money with WooCommerce. Most participants in the discussion do not seem opposed to WooCommerce making money with marketplace suggestions but are strongly requesting that they do not inject ads in places where users are working on their own products in the admin. </p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with ya&#8217;ll trying to squeeze out some more money from users &#8211; so long as it&#8217;s done tastefully, and in a way that actually provides value to the user, instead of spamming and hindering them,&#8221; @justlevine <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/23198#issuecomment-479616682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the GitHub issue. </p>\n<p>Based on the WooCommerce developer community&#8217;s feedback, many are in agreement that they will only support changes will be respectful to store owners working in the admin. They would prefer WooCommerce focused its efforts on improving the existing Extensions tab, instead of injecting items from the marketplace on other screens. The current implementation of marketplace suggestions needs work, because it is too heavy-handed in displaying ads after users indicate through the UI that they want to dismiss them. </p>\n<p>Most participants in the discussion are in favor of letting store owners decide if they want to see ads for extensions on their product admin screens. They would prefer that users opt in through a more transparent way than simply agreeing to terms of service. At the very least, most prefer WooCommerce add a setting that would allow store owners to easily turn marketplace suggestions off. If Automattic wants this new feature to be successful, the company needs to revise the implementation to be something that doesn&#8217;t instantly make the majority of the WooCommerce developer community want to turn it off. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 22:55:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 350 – Don’t Touch My Plugin Search Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88558&preview=true&preview_id=88558\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-350-dont-touch-my-plugin-search-results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1895:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss a controversial feature in Jetpack 7.1 that adds feature suggestions to plugin search results.

I spoke a bit about this kind of thing at WordCamp US last year, but if you don&#8217;t feel like sitting through a half hour video, let me summarise my thoughts. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree that React is hard. I <em>strongly</em> disagree with the commonly contrasted view that HTML, CSS, PHP, or vanilla JavaScript are easy. They&#8217;re all just as hard to work with as React, sometimes more-so, particularly when having to deal with the exciting world of cross-browser compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage that PHP has over modern JavaScript development isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s easy, or that the tooling is better, or more reliable, or anything like that. The advantage is that it&#8217;s familiar. If you&#8217;re new to web development, React is just as easy anything else to start with.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Something I’m seeing a lot.<br /><br />Beginners: This makes sense, we understand it.<br /><br />Experienced developers: There’s no way beginners would understand it.

It&#8217;s such an incomprehensible, thankless, unreliable process, the tenacity of anyone who makes it out the other side should be applauded. That said, this high barrier is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working in this industry for long enough to have forgotten the number of iterations of my personal development environment I&#8217;ve gone through, to get to where I can set up something for myself which <em>isn&#8217;t awful</em>. React wasn&#8217;t around for all of that time, so that can&#8217;t be the reason web development has been hard for as long as I remember. What is, then?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Doing Better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been tinkering with a tool to help deal with the difficulties of contributing to WordPress. That tool is called <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/testpress/\">TestPress</a>, it&#8217;s getting pretty close to being usable, at least on MacOS. Windows support is a little less reliable, but getting better. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> If you enjoy tinkering with tools, too, you&#8217;re welcome to try out the development version, but it does still has some bugs in it. Feedback and PRs are always welcome! There are some screenshots in <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/testpress/issues/114\">this issue</a> that give an idea of what the experience is like, if you&#8217;d like to check it out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TestPress is not a panacea: at best, it&#8217;s an attempt at levelling the playing field a little bit. You shouldn&#8217;t need years of experience to build a reliable development environment, that should be the bare minimum we provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>React is part of the solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do to make web development something that anyone can easily get into. I think React is part of the solution to this, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React isn&#8217;t without its problems, of course. Modern JavaScript can encourage iteration for the sake of iteration. Certainly, there&#8217;s a drive to React-ify All The Things (a trap I&#8217;m guilty of falling into, as well). React&#8217;s development model is fundamentally different to that of vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, which is why it can seem incomprehensible if you&#8217;re already well versed in the old way of doing things: it requires a shift in your mental model of how JavaScript works. This is a hard problem to solve, but it&#8217;s not insurmountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a little controversially, I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think that React is guilty of causing the web to become less accessible. At worst, it&#8217;s continuing the long standing practice of web standards making accessibility an optional extra. Building anything beyond a basic, non-interactive web page with just HTML and CSS will inevitably cause accessibility issues, unless you happen to be familiar with the mystical combinations of accessible tags, or applying aria attributes, or styling your content in just the right way (and none of the wrong ways).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React (or any component-based development system, really) can improve accessibility for everyone, and we&#8217;re seeing this with Gutenberg already. By providing a set of base components for plugin and theme authors to use, we can ensure the correct HTML is produced for screen readers to work with. Much like desktop and mobile app developers don&#8217;t need to do anything to make their apps accessible (because it&#8217;s baked into the APIs they use to build their apps), web developers should have the same experience, regardless of the complexity of the app they&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguing that accessibility needs to be part of the design process is the wrong argument. Accessibility shouldn&#8217;t be a consideration, it should be unavoidable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do Better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, can we do better? Absolutely. There&#8217;s always room for improvement. People shouldn&#8217;t need to learn React if they don&#8217;t want to. They shouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the complexities of the WCAG.

You can test this by searching for &#8220;backups&#8221; where you find that Jetpack&#8217;s commercial offering takes the place of the first result, pushing all other results further down one slot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jetpack-advertising-paid-upgrades.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The feature suggestions were added in versions 7.1 to inform users of an existing feature in Jetpack when they search for something similar. The Jetpack team said they developed it to solve a discovery problem, where users are quite often not familiar with all of Jetpack&#8217;s 45 modules and end up installing plugins to perform functionality that Jetpack already includes. A PR in the Jetpack repository has been merged to <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/11876\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">only show feature suggestions when the user&#8217;s plan supports it</a>, so it looks like these promotions for commercial features will be removed in a future release of the plugin. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Automattic intentionally rolled out the feature suggestions in its current form (with paid upgrades included) to test the waters and gauge the community&#8217;s reaction, or if it is simply a mistake. The PR was marked as an enhancement, not a bug. </p>\n<p>According to Plugin Team member Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, feature suggestions with paid upgrades included is &#8220;likely a violation&#8221; of the plugin directory&#8217;s guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Promoting other plugins or premium upgrades in the same space would likely not be allowed, because it would be misleading or an incorrect place to put &#8216;advertising,&#8217; Wood said. &#8220;Guidelines already say not to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I contacted the Plugin Team today and it seems the topic of feature suggestions on the plugin screen are still a matter of ongoing debate. The team would not officially confirm whether or not Jetpack is currently in violation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t confirm that at this time,&#8221; Mika Epstein said. &#8220;It might be a violation, but it also may not be. Much of that comes down to intent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A case can be made that they&#8217;re promoting paid services for existing features, and is that different from an image-optimizer plugin promoting it&#8217;s own service which you&#8217;re already using? It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re promoting separate plugins, so it&#8217;s in a very odd grey area for services.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Epstein said the team is &#8220;still arguing the semantics internally about that one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many people have asked why Jetpack has not been removed from the plugin directory for advertising its commercial offerings on the plugin screen. The Plugin Team&#8217;s official response is that if Jetpack is in violation, they reserve the right to make an exception and opt not to close it. Epstein, on behalf of the team, offered the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It falls under our <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#18-we-reserve-the-right-to-maintain-the-plugin-directory-to-the-best-of-our-ability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">18th guideline</a>:</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to NOT close a plugin and grant exceptions.</p>\n<p>Closing plugins is ALWAYS a tricky thing. We regularly warn, and do not close, larger plugins as closing them would have an adverse impact on the entire WordPress community. Closing plugins with 500,000 users can be more harmful than helpful, even when there are security problems. The more users a plugin gets, the more difficult it is to weigh the risks of closing versus not closing.</p>\n<p>Maintaining the trust in larger plugins is as important as doing so with the directory as a whole. With so many outlets wanting to spin up FUD and blast outrage at everyone involved as their first reaction, we try to stem the tide a little and not act like the sky is falling all the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jetpack has more than 5 million active installs. If it is found to be in violation of the guidelines, it is not likely to be removed due to the impact it would have on millions of WordPress users, not to mention the hosts who have it pre-installed on WordPress hosting plans. </p>\n<p>The discussion regarding how WordPress can improve the implementation of feature suggestions on the plugin screen for all plugins is happening in a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> on trac opened by Joost de Valk. This ticket does not debate whether or not feature suggestions are a good idea in general but rather focuses on how results can better communicate that a feature is already active or available. de Valk shared a screenshot of what the screen currently looks like when a user searches for a plugin for which they already have a match installed:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/active-plugin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The disabled &#8216;Active&#8217; button there is not very useful, as it doesn&#8217;t provide any context as to why that button is disabled,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to propose a change: let&#8217;s turn this into two separate groups of results, one that says &#8216;these plugins you already have installed might be able to help&#8217; and then a second group below that with other plugins.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tim Hengeveld posted a mockup of what an implementation of that might look like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mockup-plugin-screen.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The topic of feature suggestions on this screen is still highly controversial, despite the Plugin Team confirming that it is not breaking the guidelines (as long as plugins don&#8217;t promote paid upgrades). Plugin authors have worked for years towards better rankings on this screen by providing quality support and updates that translate into better ratings and more installs. Any mega plugin that offers multiple modules packed into one can easily usurp these rankings by suggesting its own features and having them automatically appear in that top slot. These features could even be broken down into multiple micro-modules so that there is always something to suggest. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I make a bit of side income off of <a href=\"https://t.co/aqHIydpjrL\">https://t.co/aqHIydpjrL</a> </p>\n<p>ALL folks who purchase come from free users of my WordPress(dot)org-hosted plugin. </p>\n<p>After years of hard work, it shows up first in the list when you search for the word \"Tweet.\" </p>\n<p>Unless you have Jetpack installed. <a href=\"https://t.co/9stTJ4TJre\">pic.twitter.com/9stTJ4TJre</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ben Meredith-speaking at #WCRaleigh (@benUNC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benUNC/status/1113277858540077056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Because it’s Jetpack and they’ve created this precedence with blessings from .org, it’ll be interesting to see if and how many plugin providers are going to pivot towards Jetpack’s business model of a branded ‘suite’ instead of maintaining separate plugins for separate concerns.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Caspar<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f337.png\" alt=\"🌷\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Hübinger (@glueckpress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/glueckpress/status/1113328574050787328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many in the WordPress development community are worried that plugin authors will move towards distributing their work as large suites of modules in order to take advantage of promoting their own features in the plugin search screen.

Michael Waterfall, iOS Engineer at ASOS, tested the &#8220;kill switch&#8221; function and demonstrated that it still works with prior versions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It also confirms they lied.

He found that some of these plugins are deactivated alongside admin_init, so any user attempts to reactivate the plugins will not stick.</p>\n<p>Wordfence estimates the P3 plugin to have an install base of 10,000-15,000 sites. The changes made in version 4.8.0 of the plugin are not transparently identified in the changelog, so it&#8217;s not easy for users to know what has changed. The content filtering and the plugin deactivations remain in the most recent release. These types of veiled functions performed without permission could have unintended consequences on sites using the plugin, which non-technical users may not be able to fix themselves.</p>\n<h3>Pipdig P3 Plugin Performed a DDoS Attack on a Competitor&#8217;s Site</h3>\n<p>Jem Turner, a freelance web developer based in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/2019/security-alert-pipdig-insecure-ddosing-competitors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a lengthy analysis of the P3 plugin</a> the same day that Wordfence released its analysis. She drilled down further into the remote requests, demonstrating how Pipdig has been using the P3 plugin to perform a DDoS attack on a competitor who also provides WordPress themes and installation services to bloggers. The code triggers an hourly cron job on users&#8217; sites, effectively using their customers&#8217; servers to send malicious requests to the competitor&#8217;s site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The code comment tells us this is “checking the CDN (content delivery network) cache”. It’s not. This is performing a GET request on a file (id39dqm3c0_license_h.txt) sat on pipdigz.co.uk, which yesterday morning returned ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ in the response body.</p>\n<p>Every single hour night and day, without any manual intervention, any blogger running the pipdig plugin will send a request with a faked User Agent to ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ with a random number string attached. This is effectively performing a small scale DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) on kotrynabassdesign.com’s server.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Turner also contacted <a href=\"http://kotrynabassdesign.com’\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kotryna Bass</a>, Pipdig&#8217;s competitor, who said she had contacted her host after finding that her admin-ajax.php file was under some kind of attack. Bass&#8217; exchanges with her host are also published in Turner&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>Turner&#8217;s post explained how Pipdig&#8217;s P3 plugin code manipulated links to point to their own products and services when a user includes a link to a competitor in the the content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here we have pipdig’s plugin searching for mentions of ‘blogerize.com‘ with the string split in two and rejoined – concatenated – to make it harder to find mentions of competitors when doing a mass ‘Find in Files’ across the plugin (amongst other things). When the plugin finds links to blogerize.com in blogger’s content (posts, pages), they’re swapped out with a link to ‘pipdig.co/shop/blogger-to-wordpress-migration/’ i.e. pipdig’s own blog migration services. Swapping these links out boost the SEO benefit to pipdig, and the vast majority of bloggers wouldn’t notice the switcheroo (especially as if the page/post was edited, the link to blogerize would appear in the backend as normal).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The plugin did not ask users&#8217; permission before performing any of these actions and most of them were implemented with obfuscated code. Turner&#8217;s investigation also covers how the P3 plugin could harvest data and change admin passwords. Many of the findings overlap with Wordfence&#8217;s analysis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was aware that Wordfence had been contacted for an opinion, although I was unaware they were writing a post and vice versa,&#8221; Turner said. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t surprised that they wrote about it though, given the risk to WordPress users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She has been in contact with authorities regarding Pipdig&#8217;s unethical coding practices and privacy violations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From my side of things, I&#8217;ve been in contact with Action Fraud (submitted a report through their website) and NCSC (who pointed me back to Action Fraud and gave me a number to call). From pipdig&#8217;s side, there are threats of legal action in their blog post but I&#8217;ve received nothing yet.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Pipdig&#8217;s Public Response Skirts Critical Concerns</h3>\n<p>Pipdig Creative Director Phil Clothier <a href=\"https://www.pipdig.co/blog/sad-times/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a public response</a> from the company which opens by characterizing the recent investigations as &#8220;various accusations and rumours spreading about pipdig&#8221; and includes an emotional plea regarding how  distressing recent developments have been for his company. He claims that his team and their supporters are being harassed. </p>\n<p>After pushing out the 4.8.0 version of the P3 plugin, removing some but not all of the offensive code, Clothier opts for a Q&#038;A style format for his post, putting every question in the present tense:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do you DDOS competitors?<br />\nNo.</p>\n<p>Do you “kill” sites?<br />\nNo!</p>\n<p>Do you have the ability to kill sites via the pipdig Power Pack?<br />\nNo</p></blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the &#8220;kill switch&#8221; feature they built in, which detects all tables with the WordPress prefix and drops each of them, Clothier said it was simply a function to reset a site back to its default settings. He deliberately misrepresented what it does: </p>\n<blockquote><p>There was function in an older version of the plugin which could be used to reset a site back to the default settings. This function had no risk of of malicious or unintentional use. I can say categorically that there was no risk to your site if you were using a pipdig theme. This feature has been dug up and labelled a “Kill Switch” for maximum negative impact on us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clothier claims the function was available in the P3 plugin in July 2018 when a third party started posting Pipdig themes for sale on their own site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A 3rd party was able to download all of our themes illegitimately and post them on a clone of our own site. This included previews of our themes and the ability to purchase them. We were first alerted to this by people which had purchased a pipdig theme from there, but were finding that certain features did not work correctly. After investigation, we found that the victim had purchased the theme from the 3rd party, thinking it was us. The 3rd party not only gained the financial benefit of the theme payment, but also used it as a way to inject malware and ads into the victim’s site. The reset function was put in place in order to remove the 3rd party’s ability to host preview sites with our themes. It worked, and they have since disappeared. The function was then removed in a later version of the plugin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a false claim, as Wordfence pointed out in an updated <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/04/pipdig-update-dishonest-denials-erased-evidence-and-ongoing-offenses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. The first instance of the code responsible for database deletion was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190331195426/https://bitbucket.org/pipdig/p3/commits/edc47824200e15d64cab7270debc4a0526a8d323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">committed to the plugin in November 2017</a>. </p>\n<p>The company failed to address the most critical concerns presented in the Wordfence analysis in its first pass at issuing a public statement. Instead, on the matter of coordinating a DDoS attack on competitors, Pipdig blames users and suggests they may have added the competitor&#8217;s URL to their sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re now looking into why this function is returning this url,&#8221; Clothier said. &#8220;However, it seems to suggest that some of the &#8216;Author URLs&#8217; have been set to ‘kotrynabassdesign.com’. We don’t currently know why this is the case, or whether the site owner has intentionally changed this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/04/pipdig-update-dishonest-denials-erased-evidence-and-ongoing-offenses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Further investigations</a> published by Wordfence today showed that Pipdig also added DDoS code to its Blogger templates and was actively issuing malicious requests up until yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the investigation of Pipdig’s WordPress plugin and themes, we also came across some curious code associated with their Blogger themes. This code is part of Pipdig’s suspected DDoS campaign against their competitor, and was active until April 1, four days after Pipdig’s denial of any such behavior.</p>\n<p>Some of Pipdig’s Blogger themes have been confirmed to make external JavaScript calls to Pipdig’s server, specifically to the script hXXps://pipdigz[.]co[.]uk/js/zeplin1.js.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On March 31, as the investigations became public, Pipdig deleted its public Bitbucket repository and replaced it with a &#8220;clean one,&#8221; removing three years of commit history. Wordfence and many others cloned the repository before it was deleted and saved snapshots of pages to cite in the investigation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That clean repository <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pipdig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pipdig</a> published earlier today in place of the one containing all of their malicious code&#8230; They changed the reported release date of version 4.8.0. <a href=\"https://t.co/YqKASTUZE7\">pic.twitter.com/YqKASTUZE7</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Nicky Bloor (@nickstadb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickstadb/status/1112796890855325697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pipdig&#8217;s public statement contains a number of other false claims that are outlined in Wordfence&#8217;s followup piece with code examples. Clothier closes the article by casting aspersion on the press, presumably to encourage customers not to trust what they read from other sources.</p>\n<p>I contacted Pipdig for their comment on recent events, but Clothier declined to answer any of my questions.

Regardless of the company&#8217;s motive in combatting the unauthorized distribution of their themes, these types of backdoors and undisclosed content rewrites are indefensible. They prey upon user trust and in this case the victims were primarily bloggers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think that\'s why so many of us are so angry. Bloggers are the lifeblood of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a>, you create content and for the most part don\'t have big budgets to spend. So when someone takes advantage of that those at the \"low budget\" end of the market, those that cant afford devs&#8230;</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andy Powell (@p0welly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/p0welly/status/1112384805935767552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the more puzzling aspects of this story is that many of Pipdig&#8217;s users seem to be unfazed by the gravity of the findings in these reports. Without full knowledge of the inner workings of a product, many customers make decisions based on how they feel about a company, regardless of being confronted with facts that should cause them to question their experiences.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m not concerned. I trust them. And I’m certainly not panicking and acting on the words of two blog posts citing their competitors.

I’m really angry. I trusted them for years, and in return my site has been used maliciously against other small businesses.

If you are a Pipdig customer affected by this incident, there is no assurance that the company will not build more backdoors into your site in the future. The plugin updates are not reviewed by any kind of authority. Fortunately, there are a few actions you can take to create a safer environment for your website. </p>\n<p>First, look for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-licensing-the-gpl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GPL-licensed themes and plugins</a>, because they grant you more freedoms as the user and are compatible with WordPress&#8217; legal license. GPL-licensed products are also a strong indication that the authors respect user freedoms and the shared economic principles that this open source license supports. </p>\n<p>Many reputable theme companies choose to host their products&#8217; companion plugins on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org</a> for ease of distribution and shipping updates. The official directory does not permit these kinds of shady coding practices described in this article and all of the plugins go through a security review by the WordPress Plugin Team. If you are concerned about code quality and the potential for abuse, do a little research on your next prospective commercial theme provider or opt for free WordPress.org-hosted themes and plugins that have undergone a more rigorous vetting process.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Apr 2019 05:55:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"HeroPress: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2727\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:152:\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23606:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040319-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: ... no matter how difficult or challenging things are, I stll feel very happy with what I have, and I will try to do better.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#vietnamese\">Xem nội dung tiếng Việt ở dưới.</a></p>\n<p>It’s been 13 years since I first knew WordPress. Thinking of it, I found it to be one of the most fortunate things I had in my career and life. I can do what I love, can make money to support myself, my family and have many good friends.</p>\n<p>When I found out about WordPress, I was still a second-year student at the university. The major I studied was not IT but mechanical engineering. I chose it with the desire to get a scholarship abroad (it was in Russia). But in the process of learning, I found myself inclined to and more passionate about coding. Therefore, I taught myself coding.</p>\n<p>In my second year of university, I wanted to set up a website to download software. It is not a very proud thing, because at that time I just wanted to share the software with everyone, including free software and pirated software (software pirating is still a big problem in Russia and in Vietnam). It can be said that software was what attracted me the most at that time. I was passionate about finding new software, testing, running them, finding great features and sharing experiences with people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At that time, the web was still something very new to me and I didn’t have many concepts about it. I just needed to find a free platform to build a blog about software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At that time, there were two platforms that caught my attention &#8211; WordPress and BoBlog. BoBlog was a Chinese platform (it’s dead now), and WordPress seemed more international, so I chose WordPress.</p>\n<p>It can be said that the choice of WordPress has made me learn more seriously about the web and related technologies. By editing the theme, making additional features for my blog, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. During my time at the university, I had been exploring these things and gradually improving my knowledge base.</p>\n<p>For me, the web has a big advantage comparing to other software, which is any line of code you write, you can see the result right in the browser by just pressing F5. This was the point that I was very excited about because when I tried coding in other languages, the compiling process made me feel time-consuming and not very intuitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Start_My_Own_Blog_10\">Start My Own Blog</h3>\n<p>After that, I felt that the knowledge I learned was quite interesting and wanted to share it with everyone. So I started my personal blog, it is still active at <a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/deluxeblogtips.com\">deluxeblogtips.com</a>. Blogging is an important thing in my career, maybe the most. It brings a lot of fortunate to me:</p>\n<p><strong>English:</strong> English is not my native language. But by blogging, my reading and communication skill in English has improved significantly. Although there are still many errors, I feel quite confident when talking to international friends. This has been happening for a long time and I am very grateful for it.</p>\n<p><strong>The first freelance jobs:</strong> Blogging has been around for a while, some people knew about me thanks to my helpful sharing. And they started contacting me and asked if I wanted to work for them. At that time, as a student, I was very happy, because I could earn some money. Later, when I graduated from university, I started my career with those freelance jobs. I did freelancing for about 4-5 years since 2010. I participated in many projects, learned a lot of things and knew a lot of friends. During this time, I also gathered a group of Vietnamese friends to work on those freelance jobs. Until now, although the group is no longer available, we are still good friends and still meet often.</p>\n<p><strong>Start ideas for products:</strong> precisely <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>. This is my company’s flagship product at the moment. Its idea started from my tutorial on the blog. Thanks to those sharing, it’s now a plugin of 400,000 active installs that based on a tutorial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Community_20\">Community</h3>\n<p>Blogging makes many people known about me. And my share (and other products) is also useful for many people and thanks to that, I connect with many developers around the world and in Vietnam. In 2012, when Philip Author Moore came to Vietnam, we met the first time, and it was a “fateful” meeting between us. Together, we built the WordPress community in Vietnam from those early years, started the Hanoi WordPress Meetup and shared a lot of things about WordPress. There were many companies in Vietnam starting to redirect and working on WordPress from such meetup sessions.</p>\n<p>So far, the community has been strong and we are no longer involved because we’re quite busy and we do not have too much experience in organizing and maintaining offline activities. Online activities are still very exciting thanks to Facebook!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Building_products_and_company_26\">Building products and company</h3>\n<p>Being a developer and having the opportunity to work on projects with customers, in 2010, I found many things missing from WordPress. And at that time, I had the idea of <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>, which is a developer framework to quickly create custom fields. I shared a series of tutorials on my blog. What I didn’t expect was that there were so many people having the same interest.</p>\n<p>After that, I continuously upgraded the plugin, based on feedback from other users and developers. I also get a lot of help from other developers, especially <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/unserkaiser\">Kaiser</a>. I am really grateful to them because, without them, Meta Box could not become a plugin with 400,000 active installs.</p>\n<p>When I first developed the plugin, I didn’t have much idea about commercializing it. All were free. At that time, I didn’t know much about interacting on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a> and the Trac system, so I released the code on Google Code. A long time later, I uploaded it to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/\">wordpress.org</a>. Therefore, when comparing the custom fields plugins, Meta Box is sometimes not considered the first plugin, while it should be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea of Meta Box was later inherited by many people and developed similar plugins. And I really like that, because that’s the idea of open source!</p></blockquote>\n<p>The success of Meta Box was the basis for me to establish my own company &#8211; <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a> to develop products for WordPress.</p>\n<p>In addition to Meta Box, while creating a freelance team, we also tried to become a theme provider and joined ThemeForest. It was not very successful, because I feel ThemeForest is a battlefield in which the parties race to add features to make a theme become powerful, able to do many things and therefore very bloated and not optimal. As a developer, I always feel uncomfortable with those things.</p>\n<p>The theme work then was separated into two brands of our company: <a href=\"https://fitwp.com\">FitWP</a> for themes on ThemeForest and <a href=\"https://gretathemes.com\">GretaThemes</a> for themes that are simple, optimal and serve a specific purpose. Currently, the focus of our company are Meta Box and GretaThemes.</p>\n<p>And for freelance work, we moved into a division of our company that specializes in <a href=\"https://elightup.com/projects/\">projects with customers</a>. We carry out projects for both domestic and international customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The_shift_in_roles_44\">The shift in roles</h3>\n<p>Before establishing the company, the income from the products and projects helped me and my family have a comfortable life in Vietnam. But for a long time in the WordPress community, I’ve seen many brands that I’ve always admired, especially WooThemes (now merged into Automattic). Seeing their great contributions to the community, I always want to do the same. And to do that, it’s difficult to do as an individual. So I founded <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a>, wishing to create good products and contribute to the community.</p>\n<p>When I founded the company, I did not measure all the management issues or predicted that. I had to learn a lot, from managing people, resources, finance to strategy, market research and marketing. As a developer, they are all new and challenging things. There were times when I was very stressful because I had to do both developing products and other work which were not my strength.</p>\n<p>So far, things have gotten better, I have become more comfortable to work, although I still have to code and manage at the same time.</p>\n<p>Above all, I see what I have now is big luck, and that is totally love and support from the community for me. Therefore, no matter how difficult or challenging things are, I still feel very happy with what I have and will try to do better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vietnamese\">Tiếng Việt</h2>\n<p>Đã 13 năm kể từ khi tôi biết đến WordPress lần đầu tiên. Nghĩ lại, tôi thấy đó là một trong những điều may mắn nhất mà tôi có được trong sự nghiệp và cuộc sống của mình. Tôi được làm điều mà tôi yêu thích, có thể kiếm tiền nuôi sống được bản thân, gia đình và có thêm nhiều bạn bè tốt.</p>\n<p>Khi tôi biết đến WordPress, tôi vẫn còn là 1 cậu sinh viên năm thứ 2. Chuyên ngành mà tôi học không phải là IT mà là cơ khí chế tạo máy. Tôi đã chọn chuyên ngành đó với mong muốn có được 1 suất học bổng ở nước ngoài, khi đó là ở Nga. Nhưng trong quá trình học tập, tôi thấy mình có thiên hướng và đam mê về lập trình nhiều hơn. Vì thế, tôi đã tự học và bổ sung các kiến thức về IT cho mình.</p>\n<p>Năm thứ 2 đại học, tôi muốn lập 1 website về download phần mềm. Cũng không phải là một điều tự hào gì lắm, vì lúc đó tôi chỉ muốn chia sẻ các phần mềm với mọi người, trong đó có phần mềm miễn phí và có cả phần mềm crack (vấn nạn crack phần mềm ở Nga và ở Việt Nam vẫn còn rất lớn). Có thể nói phần mềm là thứ thu hút tôi lúc đó nhiều nhất. Tôi say mê tìm phần mềm mới, thử nghiệm, chạy chúng, tìm các tính năng hay và chia sẻ kinh nghiệm với mọi người. Lúc đó, web vẫn còn là một thứ gì đó rất thô sơ và tôi cũng chưa có nhiều khái niệm về nó. Tôi loay hoay tìm một nền tảng có sẵn để xây dựng một blog về phần mềm. Vào thời điểm đó, có 2 nền tảng đã gây sự chú ý với tôi &#8211; đó là WordPress và BoBlog. BoBlog là 1 blog của Trung Quốc, còn WordPress thì có vẻ quốc tế hơn, nên tôi đã chọn WordPress.</p>\n<p>Có thể nói sự lựa chọn WordPress đã khiến tôi học hỏi nghiêm túc hơn về web và các công nghệ liên quan. Bằng cách chỉnh sửa giao diện, làm thêm các tính năng bổ sung cho blog của mình mà tôi đã học được nhiều điều về HTML, CSS, JavaScript và PHP. Trong suốt thời gian học đại học, tôi đã mày mò những cái này và dần hoàn thiện nền tảng kiến thức của mình.</p>\n<p>Đối với tôi, web có 1 điểm hơn các phần mềm khác, đó là bất kỳ dòng code nào mà bạn viết, bạn có thể thấy kết quả của nó ngay trên trình duyệt (chỉ với 1 lần nhấn F5). Đây là điểm mà tôi rất thích thú, vì trước đó tôi đã thử lập trình trên một số ngôn ngữ khác, nhưng quá trình biên dịch khiến tôi cảm thấy mất thời gian và không trực quan lắm.</p>\n<h3>Bắt đầu viết blog</h3>\n<p>Sau đó, tôi cảm thấy những kiến thức mà tôi học hỏi được cũng khá thú vị và muốn chia sẻ nó với mọi người. Và tôi bắt đầu viết blog để chia sẻ. Blog của tôi đến nay vẫn hoạt động tại <a href=\"http://deluxeblogtips.com\">deluxeblogtips.com</a>. Có thể nói viết blog là bước ngoặt quan trọng trong sự nghiệp của tôi. Nó đã giúp tôi có được nhiều thứ quyết định trong sự nghiệp của mình:</p>\n<p><strong>Tiếng Anh:</strong> tiếng Anh vốn không phải là ngôn ngữ mẹ đẻ của tôi. Nhưng nhờ trau dồi viết blog mà khả năng đọc hiểu và trao đổi bằng tiếng Anh của tôi tiến bộ rõ rệt. Mặc dù còn nhiều lỗi, nhưng tôi cảm thấy khá tự tin khi nói chuyện với bạn bè quốc tế. Việc này xảy ra trong khoảng thời gian dài và tôi rất biết ơn điều đó.</p>\n<p><strong>Những công việc freelance đầu tiên:</strong> Viết blog được 1 khoảng thời gian, nhờ những chia sẻ có ích của mình mà một số người đã biết đến tôi. Và họ bắt đầu contact với tôi và hỏi xem tôi có muốn làm việc cho họ không. Lúc đó, với 1 sinh viên thì tôi rất vui mừng, vì có thể kiếm được chút ít tiền. Về sau này, khi tôi tốt nghiệp đại học, tôi đã bắt đầu sự nghiệp của mình bằng những công việc freelance đó. Tôi đã làm freelance trong suốt khoảng 4-5 năm kể từ 2010. Tôi đã được tham gia nhiều dự án, học hỏi được rất nhiều điều và biết được thêm rất nhiều bạn bè. Trong khoảng thời gian này, tôi cũng đã tập hợp được 1 số bạn bè cùng làm WordPress tại Việt Nam thành 1 nhóm và cùng làm các công việc freelance đó. Đến nay, tuy nhóm cũ không còn, nhưng chúng tôi vẫn là những người bạn tốt và vẫn hay thường xuyên gặp nhau.</p>\n<p><strong>Bắt đầu ý tưởng cho các sản phẩm:</strong> cụ thể là <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>. Đây là sản phẩm flagship của công ty của tôi hiện tại. Ý tưởng của nó bắt nguồn từ những chia sẻ của tôi trên blog. Nhờ những chia sẻ đó mà tôi đã xây dựng 1 sản phẩm được 400.000 người sử dụng với gốc là từ 1 bài tutorial.</p>\n<h3>Cộng đồng</h3>\n<p>Viết blog khiến nhiều người biết đến tôi. Và những chia sẻ của tôi (và cả các sản phẩm nữa) cũng có ích cho nhiều người và nhờ đó tôi cũng kết nối được với nhiều bạn developer trên thế giới và ở Việt Nam. Năm 2012, khi anh Philip Author Moore tới Việt Nam, chúng tôi đã gặp nhau lần đầu tiên, và đó là buổi gặp “định mệnh” giữa chúng tôi. Cả 2 chúng tôi đã xây dựng cộng đồng WordPress Việt Nam từ những năm đầu đó, cùng start Hanoi WordPress meetup và chia sẻ rất nhiều điều về WordPress. Có rất nhiều công ty ở Việt Nam bắt đầu chuyển hướng và làm về WordPress từ những buổi meetup như vậy.</p>\n<p>Đến nay, cộng đồng đã vững mạnh và chúng tôi không còn tham gia nhiều nữa vì công việc khá bận rộn và bản thân chúng tôi cũng không có quá nhiều kinh nghiệm trong việc tổ chức và duy trì các hoạt động offline. Các hoạt động online thì vẫn diễn ra rất sôi động nhờ vào Facebook!</p>\n<h3>Xây dựng sản phẩm và công ty</h3>\n<p>Vốn là 1 developer và đã có cơ hội làm việc với các dự án với khách hàng, vào những năm 2010, tôi thấy có nhiều điều còn thiếu trong WordPress. Và lúc đó, tôi đã có ý tưởng về <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>, là một framework giúp developer tạo nhanh các custom fields. Tôi đã chia sẻ 1 loạt bài tutorial về việc xây dựng nó trên blog của mình. Và điều tôi không ngờ lúc đó là có rất nhiều người có cùng mối quan tâm như vậy.</p>\n<p>Sau đó, tôi đã liên tục nâng cấp plugin, dựa theo những phản hồi của các developer khác. Tôi cũng nhận được sự giúp đỡ rất nhiều của các bạn developer khác, mà trong đó không thể không nhắc tới <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/unserkaiser\">Kaiser</a>. Tôi thực sự rất biết ơn các bạn, cả những người dùng nữa, vì không có các bạn thì Meta Box đã không thể trở thành 1 plugin với 400.000 lượt active installs được.</p>\n<p>Khi mới phát triển plugin, tôi chưa có ý niệm nhiều về thương mại hoá nó. Toàn bộ đều được chia sẻ miễn phí. Lúc đó, tôi cũng chưa biết nhiều về tương tác trên <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a> với hệ thống Trac, nên tôi release code trên Google Code. Mãi sau này tôi mới đưa lên <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a>. Vì thế nên nhiều khi so sánh tuổi đời của các plugin về custom fields, Meta Box đôi khi không được coi là plugin đầu tiên, trong khi đúng ra là nó phải là như vậy.</p>\n<p>Ý tưởng của Meta Box sau này còn được nhiều người kế thừa và phát triển ra các plugin tương tự. Và tôi rất thích điều đó, vì đó là tư tưởng của open source!</p>\n<p>Sự thành công của Meta Box là cơ sở để tôi thành lập công ty của riêng mình &#8211; <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a> để phát triển các sản phẩm cho WordPress.</p>\n<p>Ngoài Meta Box, trong khi thành lập nhóm làm freelance, chúng tôi cũng đã thử dấn thân vào mảng làm theme và đã tham gia ThemeForest. Có thể nói là mảng đó không được thành công lắm, vì tôi cảm thấy ThemeForest là một chiến trường trong đó các bên đua nhau thêm những tính năng để cho 1 theme trở nên mạnh mẽ, làm được nhiều thứ và do đó rất nặng nề và không tối ưu. Mà tôi là 1 developer nên luôn cảm thấy không thoải mái với những điều đó.</p>\n<p>Mảng làm theme sau này phân tách ra thành 2 brands của công ty chúng tôi: <a href=\"https://fitwp.com\">FitWP</a> cho những theme trên ThemeForest và <a href=\"https://gretathemes.com\">GretaThemes</a> cho những theme đơn giản, tối ưu và phục vụ 1 mục đích cụ thể. Hiện nay thì trọng tâm của công ty chúng tôi là Meta Box và GretaThemes.</p>\n<p>Còn mảng làm freelance sau này chúng tôi tách thành một nhánh trong công ty của chúng tôi là chuyên làm các <a href=\"https://elightup.com/projects/\">dự án với khách hàng</a>. Chúng tôi thực hiện các dự án cho cả khách hàng trong nước và quốc tế.</p>\n<h3>Sự chuyển dịch vai trò</h3>\n<p>Trước khi thành lập công ty, nguồn thu nhập mà các sản phẩm và dự án mang lại cũng đã giúp tôi và gia đình có 1 cuộc sống khá thoải mái ở Việt Nam. Nhưng ở trong cộng đồng WordPress đã lâu, tôi đã thấy rất nhiều brand mà khiến tôi luôn ngưỡng mộ, trong đó nổi bật là WooThemes (nay đã không còn nữa). Thấy các đóng góp to lớn của họ cho cộng đồng, tôi cũng mong muốn mình làm được những điều tương tự. Và để làm việc đó, sức lực của 1 cá nhân rất khó. Nên tôi đã thành lập <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a>, với mong muốn tạo ra những sản phẩm tốt, đóng góp cho cộng đồng và cả những đóng góp miễn phí nữa.</p>\n<p>Khi thành lập công ty, tôi đã không lường được hết những vấn đề về mặt quản lý công ty. Tôi đã phải học rất nhiều điều, từ việc quản lý con người, nguồn lực, tài chính đến những vấn đề về định hướng, chiến lược, nghiên cứu thị trường, marketing. Đối với 1 developer, đây đều là những thứ mới mẻ và thách thức. Có những khoảng thời gian tôi đã rất áp lực, vì vừa phải phát triển sản phẩm, vừa phải làm những công việc khác vốn không phải là thế mạnh của mình.</p>\n<p>Đến nay, mọi thứ đã tốt hơn, tôi đã quen dần hơn với công việc, mặc dù tôi vẫn phải code và quản lý cùng một lúc.</p>\n<p>Nhưng mà, trên tất cả, tôi thấy những gì mà mình có được bây giờ đều là sự may mắn, và đó đều là sự yêu thương, support từ cộng đồng đã dành cho tôi. Bởi thế, cho dù mọi thứ có khó khăn, thách thức như thế nào, tôi vẫn cảm thấy rất vui với những gì mình đang có, và sẽ cố gắng để làm mọi thứ tốt hơn.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Growing%20a%20WordPress%20business%20in%20Vietnam&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F&title=Growing+a+WordPress+business+in+Vietnam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040319-min-150x150.jpg&description=Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/\" title=\"Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/\">Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Apr 2019 02:00:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Anh Tran\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 7.1 Adds Feature Suggestions to Plugin Search Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88404\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10445:\"<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/03/05/jetpack-7-1-business-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 7.1</a> was released earlier this month with new blocks for WordAds, Business Hours, Contact Info, Slideshows, and Videos. This release also quietly added suggestions to the plugin search screen, a change that has not been well-received by the developer community. If a user searches for a plugin that has a feature that is already offered by Jetpack, the plugin will insert an artificial (and dismissible) search result into the first plugin card slot, identifying the corresponding Jetpack feature. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.30.07-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Although these suggestions in plugin search results were not presented as a headline feature in the 7.1 release post, it was clearly listed in the changelog under enhancements. More people began taking notice after WordPress developer Mehul Gohil tweeted a screenshot of it on a live site:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nowadays, plugin search in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> admin suggests a product/add-on. I see the future of these suggestions to be used by plugin authors to keep their product first in certain plugin search terms for upsells like admin notices. </p>\n<p>What do you think about this? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontHijackWPAdmin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DontHijackWPAdmin</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TERjrPgEt6\">pic.twitter.com/TERjrPgEt6</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Mehul Gohil (@mehul_gohil0810) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehul_gohil0810/status/1110488258587308033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Manipulating search results, even to insert an artificial result, using a plugin that is already installed, is a major new development among plugins hosted on WordPress.org. Automattic is setting a precedent for other plugin authors that want to recommend their own add-ons or extensions when users match certain search terms. </p>\n<p>In the feature&#8217;s initial <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/10611\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proof of concept</a>, Jetpack product lead Beau Lebens explained the motivation behind adding suggestions to the search screen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve seen that people with Jetpack installed and activated often search for Jetpack features (even by name) in the Plugins > Add New screen in wp-admin. This new module attempts to spot those searches, and provide an artificial search result that calls out that what they&#8217;re looking for is in Jetpack, which they already have, and which is already active.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eight years since its initial release, Jetpack has grown to 45 modules. Most users are not familiar with everything the plugin offers. In fact, many users may not have even installed Jetpack themselves, as it often comes pre-installed with hosting. The suggestions may prevent users from adding alternate third-party plugins, as Jetpack&#8217;s module placement in the results subtly implies that these are inferior options to its existing modules. </p>\n<p>One of the reasons the feature has many developers rattled is because the UI fails to make it clear that this is an artificial result and not something generated by the plugin directory&#8217;s algorithm. Although it is intended to function more as a notice, for the regular user, it is virtually indistinguishable from an advertisement in its current implementation. It hasn&#8217;t been live for very long, but over time it may even make it more difficult for plugin developers to offer plugins that compete with Jetpack features.</p>\n<p>The feature suggestions in plugin search results became a hot topic on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status</a>&#8216; Slack where Automattic&#8217;s Gary Pendergast dropped in to reiterate the Jetpack team&#8217;s intentions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been talking to some folks on Jetpack about what’s going on,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;I think the team’s end goal is pretty good, and it solves a real problem WordPress has. Too often, site owners install masses of plugins that they don’t need, which ultimately creates all sorts of security, performance, and stability issues. In this particular use case, if a site owner is looking for functionality that Jetpack already handles, then the owner should be aware of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast also said he thinks WordPress core should offer an API for any plugin to be able to do something similar.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Team Says Jetpack&#8217;s Artificial Search Results Do Not Break WordPress.org Guidelines</h3>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s easy to conjure up different ways to abuse this avenue for advertising a plugin&#8217;s existing features, WordPress.org&#8217;s plugin team is ready to deal with a potential influx of various implementations on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really advertising anything &#8211; it&#8217;s just adding search results for pieces of a plugin that you already have and might not know about, so it&#8217;s not really against any rules,&#8221; Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;If it was misleading in some manner, then that would be different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood said the team discussed it but concluded that any implementation of something similar in other plugins will need to be reviewed to see if it&#8217;s doing anything misleading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Realistically it&#8217;s always going to be a judgment call of some sort,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;For example, if a plugin was to insert search results for other plugins, then that wouldn&#8217;t be okay, because it&#8217;s misleading. But, this isn&#8217;t that case. It&#8217;s just trying to say &#8216;hey, you have a plugin already installed which does what you&#8217;re looking for,&#8217; so it&#8217;s trying to be helpful in that respect. It may not necessarily be the best way of accomplishing that goal, admittedly. But it&#8217;s pretty valid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood did not place a hard requirement on having the artificial result be dismissible but said anytime a developer inserts something into a screen where would not normally be, having dismiss functionality is good UX. He doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s likely that many other plugin authors will implement something similar since most are not collections of dozens of plugins and add-ons. However, this type of suggestion seems like it would also be applicable to block collection plugins that include dozens of Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be really difficult for users when all the essential plugin authors implement it,&#8221; Gohil said in response to comments on the screenshot he tweeted. &#8220;They are using JS to hack into plugin search using hook &#8216;admin_enqueue_scripts&#8217; and that&#8217;s not good. I&#8217;m not in favor of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If more plugin authors begin adding suggestions, users could see several rows of artificial results before seeing any real ones, depending on which plugins they have installed. Plugin developers are already brainstorming ways to strip the feature suggestions out. It likely will not be long before plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hide-jetpack-promotions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hide Jetpack Promotions</a> removes the artificial search results to maintain results as delivered by WordPress.org. </p>\n<p>Wood said the plugin team does not intend to write any new guidelines for plugin authors creating their own implementations of feature suggestions on the search screen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The difference is always going to be one of intent,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;It&#8217;s JP&#8217;s intent here to notify the user of the existence of a feature they may not know about. That&#8217;s trying to be helpful to the user, not trying to shut out competition. It doesn&#8217;t remove search results. It doesn&#8217;t reorder them or filter them. It just adds a card about the feature you&#8217;re searching for. If you don&#8217;t have JP, then it can&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s not advertising for other plugins or anything like that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack is also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/361a99f6ae70152b52142aa682c8a6c25b5afc04/modules/plugin-search.php#L291-L292\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tracking search terms longer than three characters</a>, and Wood confirmed that this is also within the guidelines, as long as it is disclosed to the user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole tracking module doesn&#8217;t activate until after you agree to the ToS thingy, so honestly, it&#8217;s allowed,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;They track lots of things for stats and such. Realistically, so do many other plugins. As long as you ask the user first, before tracking anything, then tracking data is allowed. Opt-in is the rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood said he found the search term tracking to be unnecessary since WordPress.org already collects this information through its new search system that runs on ElasticSearch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We get all the search terms on the WordPress.org servers, anyway, so both we and they kinda already have them,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;Automatticians built our newest plugin search engine, after all. It seems kind of a waste to track them using Jetpack when they literally receive all the searches to run through the search engine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack’s artificial search results, although dismissible, take up the top spot, bypassing the algorithm altogether. It gives the appearance that Jetpack&#8217;s built-in feature is either a promoted listing or superior to all other options available in the directory. </p>\n<p>Although a suggested module may work more harmoniously with other Jetpack features than a third-party plugin, the modules are built to be fairly general in terms of features. They address the basic needs for the largest number of users but rarely provide more options than a standalone plugin dedicated to performing something similar. Users may very well be searching for a replacement for what Jetpack provides. The ability to easily turn off suggestions in search results with a toggle could go a long way for diplomacy. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 15:40:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Automattic Launches Happy Tools Product Line for Distributed Teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88372\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-happy-tools-product-line-for-distributed-teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3144:\"<p>Automattic has <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/happy-tools-the-future-of-work/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> Happy Schedule, the first in a new line of products called &#8220;<a href=\"https://happy.tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Tools</a>,&#8221; created to solve problems for distributed teams. The products have grown out of internal tools that Automattic uses with its distributed team of more than 850 employees in 68 countries. </p>\n<p>Most employee scheduling tools are designed for more traditional work environments where people report to work in person in the same timezone. <a href=\"https://happy.tools/#products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Schedule</a> allows employees to set their own flexible schedules all the way down to 15-minute increments, seamlessly managing timezones for team members in one calendar. Automattic uses it to manage 24-hour global support with its 300+ Happiness Engineers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/happy-schedule.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Happy Tools is currently priced at $60/month for 12 users and then $5/user after that. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to Happy Schedule, we&#8217;ll be looking to bring our customer chat tool into Happy Tools,&#8221; Happy Tools product lead Matt Wondra said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also look at other applications Automattic has already built to help with team communication, people-management, and customer support.” </p>\n<p>The product suite complements Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-publishes-ted-talk-on-the-future-of-work-prepares-to-launch-new-distributed-blog-website\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TED talk</a> in which he evangelizes distributed work as &#8220;the future of work.&#8221; Mullenweg predicts that companies will evolve to become distributed first or will soon be replaced by ones that are.</p>\n<p>Beyond simply recognizing the benefits of employees being able to design their own work environments, there are some real challenges to becoming a distributed company. This is especially true for those that didn&#8217;t start out that way. Smaller companies have less experience navigating all the tax laws and legal processes around hiring people from different countries. These hurdles make it difficult to grow an international team and retain employees as anything more than hourly contractors.</p>\n<p>Answering some of these difficult questions gets into the meat of making distributed teams a reality. With its position as one of the few distributed companies that has successfully scaled into the hundreds, Automattic has an opportunity to open source some of its counsel, documents, and HR guides around international hiring. This would be a valuable addition to <a href=\"http://distributed.blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">distributed.blog</a> or the Happy Tools blog that would help more companies move beyond their initial explorations of distributed work and ultimately create a larger market for these kinds of tools.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 04:28:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WordPress.org blog: Minimum PHP Version update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2947:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 is targeted for release at the end of this month, and with it comes an update to the minimum required version of PHP.  WordPress will now require a minimum of PHP 5.6.20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning in WordPress 5.1, users running PHP versions below 5.6 have had a notification in their dashboard that includes <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">information to help them update PHP</a>. Since then, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress stats</a> have shown an increase in users on more recent versions of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-10.30.34-PM.png?resize=632%2C265&ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of the \" />The dashboard widget users see if running an outdated version of PHP \n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your site is running on an unsupported version of PHP, the WordPress updater will not offer WordPress 5.2 to your site. If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\">PHP 5.6 is going to become the minimum required PHP version for WordPress</a>, a significant step towards a more modern web and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">updated coding standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-2-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in beta</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

It&#8217;s been four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this post there are 165 essays published. 165 stories of dreams, successes, failures, and courage. 165 people I&#8217;ve gotten to know and love. It feels like it&#8217;s always been there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while this last year I only published once a month, so I could both focus on work a little more as well as draw attention to past essays. A few weeks ago I went back to weekly, and I&#8217;m happy with it. It&#8217;s exciting getting to know a new person every week. Not just meet them, but have good conversation and really get to know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some fun news. The other day <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden?s=17\">Josepha The Magnificent</a> approached me about syndicating HeroPress on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/\">https://wordpress.org/news/</a>. It&#8217;s already on <a href=\"https://planet.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Planet</a> (Thanks Matt!), which is the number one driver of traffic to this site, by FAR. I&#8217;ll be interested to see what being on /news does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often ask me about the future of HeroPress, but I don&#8217;t really see it changing much. Getting syndicated is nice, but doesn&#8217;t really change what I do or publish. We did a <a href=\"https://heropress.com/announcing-up-running-scholarship-heropress-wpshout/\">scholarship giveaway</a> a couple years ago and we&#8217;ve discussed doing it again. I really enjoyed that, I&#8217;d welcome more things like it from other organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To all of you who&#8217;ve read over the years, I thank you.  To all of you who&#8217;ve been transparent and had the courage to let the world see your story, I can&#8217;t thank you enough. Every time someone says to me &#8220;HeroPress is such an encouragement to me&#8221; it&#8217;s because of you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the future, and many more stories.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Four Years\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Four%20Years&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Ffour-years%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Four Years\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Ffour-years%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Ffour-years%2F&title=Four+Years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Four Years\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/four-years/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/plugins/rtsocial/images/default-pinterest.png&description=Four Years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Four Years\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/four-years/\" title=\"Four Years\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/four-years/\">Four Years</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 02:49:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Asia Proposed for 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88339\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-proposed-for-2020-in-bangkok-thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2775:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bangkok.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eustaquio/9699604924\">Eustaquio Santimano</a>\n<p>The organizers of WordCamp Asia, a brand new regional WordCamp, have published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/03/29/wordcamp-asia-proposal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> for making Bangkok, Thailand, the host city for a 2-3 day event in early 2020. They are currently planning for February or March to avoid clashing with other regional WordCamps (WCEU, WCUS). The camp has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">informally discussed since 2015</a> while organizers focused on growing new city-based WordCamps across the region.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamps in Asia have reached a critical mass that will enable a successful regional WordCamp,&#8221; Jon Ang said in the  introduction to the proposal. &#8220;We believe that running this WordCamp will contribute directly to long term efforts in fostering WordPress interest in countries that lack it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Asia organizers are being mentored by lead organizers of WordCamp Europe and have created an official proposal based heavily on the one submitted by WordCamp Nordic organizers. They have submitted it to the broader WordCamp community leaders for review before submitting and official application to WordCamp Central. </p>\n<p>Asia has many vibrant and diverse WordPress communities across distant geographical areas. It technically includes Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey, Israel, and Iran, as well as all of Russia and India and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke commented on the proposal, asking if it is actually a “WordCamp South-East Asia,&#8221; given all the currently listed organizers are from this region, or if they intend to include other countries beyond this area. Ang said that the event will certainly include leaders from India and Pakistan and they have discussed forming a global team with two representatives from each country. The leaders currently listed in the proposal are those who were specifically involved in drafting it.</p>\n<p>Bangkok is proposed for the first host city due to its relatively affordable location, the ease of obtaining a visa on arrival for attendees from many Asian counties, and the availability of inexpensive flights to most major cities in Asia. The local WordPress community is also experienced at running large WordCamps (500+ attendees) and Bangkok&#8217;s local meetup group has more than 1,500 members.

He shared a screenshot of the playground in action:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gutenberg-playground.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>During Tuesday&#8217;s JavaScript chat meeting, Benguella elaborated on the playground&#8217;s intended use. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re expanding the usage of Gutenberg outside of the edit-post and also talking about cross-CMS usage and external usage (in the broad sense), we need a way to run the block editor in a context independent from the WordPress Admin. This means no WordPress admin styles, no API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Testing Gutenberg in the playground&#8217;s &#8220;no-context&#8221; mode allows developers to ensure their components don&#8217;t rely on  WP-Admin styles to be present. Benguella said it demonstrates how core blocks can be used without requiring a post object, which will be useful for architecting the widgets screen. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This playground could evolve to contain examples of our reusable components (think Storybook),&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;It could also serve as a contributor tool. For example, we could include a way to search for selectors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The playground was just merged this week, so contributors are working on better documentation.

The upcoming release introduces new blocks for RSS, Search, Calendar, Tag Cloud, and Amazon Kindle embed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/block-manager-modal-e1553096924444.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>The proliferation of block collection plugins as a block distribution mechanism has caused some WordPress installations to become bloated with too many unused blocks. Version 5.2 includes new block management capabilities that will make it easy to turn blocks on or off and tidy up the block inserter tool for greater efficiency.</p>\n<p>This release also introduces <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fatal error protection</a> that catches errors before they produce a white screen, so that users can still log into the admin to attempt to resolve the issue. This feature was previously <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-1-to-introduce-new-white-screen-protection-feature-beta-1-now-available-for-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">targeted for 5.1</a> but needed a few security issues ironed out before it was ready for core.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re just getting started with testing WordPress, the 5.2 beta is a very approachable release with features that anyone can put through the paces. The easiest way is to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Beta Testing</a> plugin and select &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies.&#8221; Try out the new blocks, experiment with turning blocks and and off. Do the new features seem like they work as advertised? Are there any bumps in the road when trying to use them? You can report any issues to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha/Beta</a> area in the support forums or <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">log a ticket on trac</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers have a few big items to test as well. Plugin authors can now <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">specify a minimum PHP version</a> that the plugin will support. WordPress is also adding the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45806\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sodium_compat library</a>, a libsodium-compatible cryptography API for PHP 7.2+. </p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/27/dev-chat-summary-march-27/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a> from today&#8217;s core developer chat, there are currently 116 open tickets that contributors plan to address in three betas. The goal is to slash that number down to 66 before beta 2.

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.2 Beta two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (choose the “bleeding edge nightlies” option)</li><li>Or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-2/\">April 30</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has received significant performance improvements since WordPress 5.1, shaving 35% off the load time for massive posts, and cutting the keypress time (how responsive it feels when you&#8217;re typing) in half!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility continues to improve, too. The block editor now supports your browser&#8217;s reduced motion settings. The post URL slug has better labelling and help text. The focus styling for keyboard navigating through landmarks is clearer and more consistent. There are a variety of new speak messages, and existing messages have been tweaked for more useful screen-reader behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added several new blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An RSS block</li><li>An Amazon Kindle embed block</li><li>A Search block</li><li>A Calendar block</li><li>A Tag Cloud block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you keep track of these blocks, and only show the ones you need, there&#8217;s a new block management tool to switch blocks on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?fit=632%2C474&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6806\" />Block Management Modal\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on existing blocks, too. There are hundreds of bug fixes and improvements in the block editor, you can read more about them in the Gutenberg plugin releases: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-23th-january/\">4.9</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-february/\">5.0</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/\">5.1</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-march/\">5.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">5.3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The WordPress Mobile Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor isn&#8217;t just for websites, either. The WordPress mobile apps now include an experimental version of a built-in block editor. This is still under development, but you can try it out now!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/\">The block editor is coming to the mobile apps</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phase of this project (originally scoped for WordPress 5.1) is now included in WordPress 5.2. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>). Before, you’d have to FTP in to your files or get in touch with your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">The Improved Fatal Error Protection</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we&#8217;re adding a new Health Check tool to your Dashboard. Visit the <em>Tools</em> menu and click on <em>Health Check</em> to get information that can help improve the speed and security of  your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PHP Version Bump</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">WordPress will increase its minimum supported PHP version to 5.6</a>. To help you check if you&#8217;re prepared for this change, WordPress 5.2 will show you a warning and help you upgrade your version of PHP, if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plugins can now specify the minimum version of PHP that they support, so you can safely modernise your development practices without risking breaking your users&#8217; sites. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">#40934</a>)</li><li>We&#8217;ve added the <code>sodium_compat</code> library, which provides backwards compatibility for the <a href=\"https://blog.zend.com/2018/11/06/modern-cryptography-in-php-7-2-with-sodium/\">Sodium-based cryptography library added in PHP 7.2</a>.

It performs an automated code review on pull requests using <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PHPCS</a>. This Action is based on WordPress.com VIP&#8217;s GPL-licensed <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-ci\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">review scripts</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/automated-phpcs-code-review.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Our action is a wrapper around the original <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-ci\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vip-go-ci</a> project,&#8221; rtCamp CEO Rahul Bansal said. &#8220;VIP’s project uses Teamcity which is expensive and very hard to get up and running. We built a wrapper around it to get it working with Github. Still huge props to them for sharing what we consider to be the USP of the VIP platform to the public at large.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deploy WordPress GitHub action</a> uses the <a href=\"https://deployer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deployer.org</a> tool to deploy code changes. Using it requires your git repo to match rtCamp&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/wordpress-skeleton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Skeleton</a> which is very similar to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-skeleton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VIP Go Skeleton</a>. The action includes optional support for <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hashicorp Vault</a>, which is useful for managing multiple servers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our action supports secrets fetching via HashiCorp Vault project,&#8221; Bansal said. &#8220;For small teams or indies using Vault might be overkill. But at scale, such as our hosting dept, where they are responsible for more than 100+ servers, <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress#hashicorp-vault-optional\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vault streamlines WordPress Deploys</a>.

There are no technical details available yet for what approach core will take, because it&#8217;s still in the experimental stage. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/gutenberg-phase-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">site building objectives in Phase 2</a> are currently the primary focus of the Gutenberg team. </p>\n<p>Although Phase 4 is still a long way off (targeted for 2020 and beyond), WordPress multilingual product owners are starting to speculate about the impact of core offering its own standardized solution for multilingual sites. At WordCamp Nordic I had a quick chat with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nullbytes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Windisch</a>, CIO of <a href=\"https://inpsyde.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Inpsyde</a>, a large WordPress agency in Germany and the creators of the <a href=\"https://multilingualpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MultilingualPress</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>Windisch predicts a culling of the multilingual solutions for WordPress after Phase 4, in the same way that Gutenberg has challenged page builders. Maintaining a plugin with thousands of users takes a toll on a company, because users require support and product owners need to have a way to continue offering something that isn&#8217;t already available by default in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same with Gutenberg and all the page builders,&#8221; Windisch said. &#8220;You need to adapt. If core tackles 80-90% of the features the plugin does, then I&#8217;m sure some will decide to pursue other roads or extend core features with a new plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Windisch doesn&#8217;t see any issues for his company&#8217;s multilingual solution because of how it is architected to closely align with WordPress core in its use of multisite. The MultilingualPress website advertises the product as having &#8220;future-proof, WordPress core-based architecture.&#8221; Windisch said that big agencies and companies with local sites tend to opt for MultilingualPress&#8217; solution because of the separation of access that multisite provides.</p>\n<p>After some consideration, he said he found that Mullenweg&#8217;s timeline for getting multilingual support in core made sense, because existing solutions mean there is no pressing need to provide this functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently nobody waits for the multilingual in core, because there are already solutions out there,&#8221; Windisch said. &#8220;There&#8217;s not really the pressure to have it right now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the quick interview below to hear more thoughts on how Gutenberg Phase 4 may impact other multilingual solutions:</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 19:00:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: Codecademy Launches New Free PHP Course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88229\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/codecademy-launches-new-free-php-course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2262:\"<p>Codecademy introduced a new free course today called <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Learn PHP</a>. The company, which offers free coding courses, is rebuilding its PHP education after removing all of its PHP courses in 2017. </p>\n<p>A Codecademy representative <a href=\"https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/php-sunset/85690/4\">explained</a> that the courses were outdated and that their team thought PHP was declining in popularity:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The PHP courses were very old, buggy, and outdated. They were the least used courses on Codecademy by far, and declining in use all the time, just as PHP itself is declining in popularity in the web development world. Student demand was far higher towards making, for example, more content in other languages like JavaScript or offer all-new languages like C#, rather than continuing to maintain PHP. Continued support and maintenance of any course for us costs money, and hiring PHP specialists to rewrite a course costs more money, but the market for PHP is very small. So, the decision was clear – to sunset this course.</p></blockquote>\n<p>PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, and it is still going strong 25 years later. Roughy <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">80% of websites run on PHP</a>.

Codecademy Pro users will get more quizzes and will create a portfolio project to showcase their new skills, but the basic course is free.

Marco Fernandes and Thor Andre Gretland, representatives of the 45-person agency based in Europe, are also part of the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project that brings WordPress&#8217; open source editor to Drupal via an optional module. The module&#8217;s release candidate has been downloaded more than 9,000 times. </p>\n<p>In the video below, I had the opportunity to sit down with the team at WordCamp Nordic to discuss the progress on their Gutenberg-related projects. Frontkom has clients using the Drupal module in production and their experience echoes a theme that seems common among those who are using the Gutenberg editor with clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see that especially people who don&#8217;t have too much experience in general working with visual content online, they find it easier to use than the ones that are into a routine where they expect some behavior,&#8221; Gretland said.</p>\n<p>Drupal&#8217;s Gutenberg module could become a primary driver for the Gutenberg Cloud project, as access to the cloud blocks is included by default for all installations. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloud-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Blocks</a> plugin for WordPress has been much less popular so far, with an estimated 100 active installations. </p>\n<p>We discussed the potential of Drupal adopting Gutenberg as its core editor and the Frontkom team predicts that it will likely remain a separate module. Their vision for both Drupal Gutenberg and the Gutenberg Cloud is to make Gutenberg &#8220;the go-to solution for editing rich content on the web.&#8221; It is still achievable as a separate module but would have more impetus behind it if Drupal adopted it for its default editor.</p>\n<p>Gretland said idea behind the Gutenberg Cloud was to provide &#8220;a sustainable ecosystem of blocks but also ease of use.&#8221; The project is a precursor to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-explores-proposal-for-new-block-directory-to-host-single-block-plugins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org&#8217;s planned JS-only single block library</a>. We discussed whether they perceive any competition between the two directories. </p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> on make.wordpress.org was just developing at the time of the interview, I contacted Frontkom CTO Per Andre Rønsen later on to get their thoughts on WordPress.org&#8217;s planned block directory. He had commented on the proposal, asking if this could become a library of truly CMS-agnostic blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/#comment-8947\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the Make WP blog post right away, because I simply loved the idea of a directory of JS-only blocks,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;We haven’t discussed it directly with Matt, but have had some good chats with the core Gutenberg team, and are planning to meet on a weekly basis. If Gutenberg Cloud can serve as a proof of concept that WP.org can later adopt as their own, we are happy. As the spec is very similar to what we already have created, porting between the two will be easy.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Rønsen is advocating for a more open approach that isn&#8217;t so strictly tied to WordPress&#8217; infrastructure. </p>\n<p>&#8220;A more ideal approach however, would be to merge the two efforts,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;The key for us, is to make the infrastructure open to other communities, not just WP developers. We are happy to put our project in the hands of the WP core team – given that they share the same open vision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A CMS-agnostic library for Gutenberg blocks is part of Frontkom&#8217;s long term vision for improving the open web. This is one of reasons the team created Gutenberg.js, which provides a foundation for using Gutenberg on any CMS or framework. Gretland said they see it as &#8220;more than just a new editor but a platform that enables communities to build new features.&#8221; This is the vision the team came to share at WordCamp Nordic. Check out the video below to hear more about how the Gutenberg Cloud team is working to make Gutenberg an editor that more open source communities on the web can share.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 20:00:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 349 – Sandy Edwards and the Kids Event Working Group Initiative\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88216&preview=true&preview_id=88216\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-349-sandy-edwards-and-the-kids-event-working-group-initiative\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2166:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://sandyedwards.me/\">Sandy Edwards</a>.

Roughly 20% are on versions 5.5 or earlier.

With its influence and dominant market share, this requirement would inevitably force users to get on board. However, WordPress contributors believe in supporting users who, for whatever reason, need more help upgrading PHP. Steamrolling this requirement has not been the WordPress way, despite years of immense pressure from the developer community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Leaving users behind for technical reasons creates a two-folded web with only few being able to leverage its power,&#8221; WordPress Core Committer Felix Arntz said. &#8220;Collaborating with and supporting these users gives that power to everyone in the long run.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gary Pendergast shared a few stats about how effective <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-1-improves-editor-performance-encourages-users-to-update-outdated-php-versions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 5.1&#8217;s PHP update notice</a> has been in prodding site owners to get on newer versions of PHP:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For WordPress 5.0, sites updated their PHP version from PHP <= 5.6 to PHP 7+ at the rate of 1 basis point per day. That is, the percentage of WordPress 5.0 sites using PHP <= 5.6 dropped by 0.01 every day, prior to the release of WordPress 5.1.\n</p>\n<p>For WordPress 5.1 (after adding the update notice), that has increased to a steady 5 basis points per day. Doesn’t sounds like much? Every day, that’s hundreds of extra site owners choosing to go through the (frankly, terrifying) process of updating their PHP version. All they needed was a little extra nudge, and a little bit of information.</p>\n<p>Scary EOL notices and attitudes of “well, we’re just bumping our supported PHP version, too bad if you don’t know what to do next” don’t help. Giving people the information they need to help themselves works.</p>\n<p>WordPress folks are doing our part to help clean up the ancient PHP installs that are still running a large percentage of the internet, and we’re find that this isn’t an insurmountable problem. It just requires a bit of patience and empathy to solve.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress developers around the web sent out celebration tweets after the news was announced. Although PHP 5.6 is the new minimum required version for running WordPress, the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technical requirements</a> page recommends users ask their hosts for PHP version 7.3 or greater. PHP 7+ offers massive performance gains for users and developers will be able to update their plugins to use more modern syntax. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is big news!! </p>\n<p>WPGraphQL has a minimum requirement of PHP 5.6, so it couldn’t even be considered for core until now. </p>\n<p>Still a ways to go before we’re ready for serious consideration, but pretty big news. <a href=\"https://t.co/gCbJM9VcRc\">https://t.co/gCbJM9VcRc</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; GraphQL for WordPress (@wpgraphql) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpgraphql/status/1108548227882602496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 04:10:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 5.3 Introduces Block Management, Adds Nesting to the Cover Block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88148\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-5-3-introduces-block-management-adds-nesting-to-the-cover-block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3894:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/block-manager-modal-e1553096924444.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 5.3</a> was released today with basic block management, a feature that will be included in WordPress 5.2. It is a new modal that can be launched from the vertical ellipses menu, inspired by Rich Tabor&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v9rXLDv-FM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks implementation</a>. Users can turn individual blocks on/off or even entire sections, such as Common Blocks, Formatting, and Embeds. Block management should help users avoid the bloat that happens when installing block collections with more blocks than they need. </p>\n<p>This version&#8217;s updates to the Cover Block make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13822\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">nest other blocks inside of it</a>. Users can now add buttons, paragraphs, and headers to easily create a call to action. It&#8217;s not immediately evident that nesting blocks is possible, despite the floating inserter. It takes a little bit of time to discover that it is available. There are still some quirks with this feature, but overall it makes the Cover Block much more useful than previous versions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-20-at-11.53.48-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>A few contributors commenting on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13822\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cover Block&#8217;s nesting PR</a> said that it seems like the work on this iteration is essentially a light version of a section block. They questioned if it might be better to finish the work on the Section block (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#4900</a>) and build from there. Many developers and designers are eagerly awaiting the addition of a Section block to core, which will provide a standard for the plugin and theme industries to build on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the cover block has very specific functionality that the section may not have like the focal point selector,&#8221; Automattic JavaScript engineer Jorge Costa said. &#8220;It is also important to note that the adjustments we make here to the way nesting works will also benefit a future section. This also allows us to test nesting a little bit more, before going to the section block. I expect the section block to be widely used in the community and will probably serve as a basis for many things being built in the future so it is important that we get it right. Exploring in cover will contribute to that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.3 adds an experimental Legacy Widget Block that allows existing WordPress widgets to be added as Gutenberg blocks. It offers a dropdown of available widgets. After selecting one, the block populates that area with the widget&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-20-at-12.49.23-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This version also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14145\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">improves block outlines for the hover and selected states</a> for a more accessible UI with less distraction. Performance benchmarks show a slight decrease in performance with Gutenberg 5.3.

Negative or positive, they affected you in a way that helped create the person you are.</p>\n<h3>The Early Days</h3>\n<p>Her father said to her, “Jean, you are always welcome but leave your kids at home.” That I will remember until the day I die. Why? We were biracial. My mother (who was White) left her home in Virginia to run away to Cleveland with my father (who was Black, and from West Virginia) to get married. That was in 1956.</p>\n<p>My father left us when I was about 8. Left us high and dry. The only positive thing I remember that he gave me was a typewriter. He said to me, “Teach yourself how to type and you’ll always be able to make a living.” I didn’t realize he “gave me anything” until after he died.</p>\n<p>After my second failed marriage, I moved my Mom in with me because she was ill. That was 2005 and that’s when my journey with WordPress began. I originally started using Joomla but found that it was too cumbersome to keep up-to-date because things needed to be done manually, whereas WordPress had this cool way of updating the plugins right inside the dashboard. I was hooked and left Joomla behind.</p>\n<p>I went back to work full time at one of the local hospitals. But not even a year into it I quit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One morning as I am waiting for the home health aide to arrive, my Mom started to cry and said, “I don’t want to die alone.” I stopped and looked at her and said, “You aren’t going to die alone.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>That day, I got to work and one of the doctor’s pissed me off. I thought about what my Mom said and then starting thinking, “I don’t need this bullshit.” I went to my desk and started packing my things. My co-worker said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I quit.” She said, “What?” I said, “I quit.” The doctor ran out, “What are you doing and where are you going?” I said, “I quit, and you can kiss my ass!”</p>\n<p>I got home too early and my Mom asks, “Why are you home?” I just stood there. She looked at me and said, “Did you quit?” I started laughing, “Yep sure did and told that doctor he could kiss my ass!” She started giggling! “We’ll be okay.” she said.</p>\n<h3>Shifting Gears</h3>\n<p>At that moment I said I must take this hobby of building sites part time, to a full fledge business. I hunkered down in one of the upstairs bedrooms and started to write out my strategy. I had already completed a few small business websites, so I contacted them and from there and word of mouth, my business started to grow.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t until after my Mom died that WordPress really saved my life.</p>\n<p>We were thick as thieves my Mom and me. She almost died having me. I had a sister (she died last April) but she wasn’t close to us and kept mainly to herself. But Mom and I…we were two peas in a pod all the way up to the day she died. I sat with her for five days in hospice and those were some of the longest days and nights of my life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt like someone dropped a weight on my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I felt faint. I felt lost.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank God I had Buster, my dog. If it hadn’t been for him, I don’t know what I would have done. There was a night I just couldn’t bear not having my Mom. I had a bottle of Valium and thought, “I should just get it over with, go be with my Mom.” But I looked down at Buster and thought, “No one is going to take better care of him than me. I can’t do that to him.”</p>\n<p>I struggled with depression. Slowly over time I couldn’t function to even work on projects. It finally got to a point where my gas was turned off in the winter and I didn’t have food. I was bundled up with blankets and small heaters in my house to stay warm.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every penny I got, was basically food for Buster. One time I went 5 days without food.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My car was repossessed. It was just crazy. Then I got evicted in mid-January 2013. Yep, evicted.</p>\n<p>My sister, who I wasn’t close to, had received a lump sum of money from Social Security. She sent money to me since I had cared for our Mom all that time by myself. I rented a van, packed up what I could fit in the U-Haul on my own and ended up at an Extended Stay hotel – in the middle of a blizzard. Left all my furniture behind because I didn’t have help.</p>\n<p>I got to the hotel and sat there in the U-Haul. I looked in the mirror and said out loud, “How the fuck did you get here? You don’t even have a pot to piss in!” Buster sitting in the other seat looking at me like I was crazy. That’s when I knew I had hit rock bottom. Depression led me to the bottom.</p>\n<h3>Rising Up</h3>\n<p>But… that was a good thing! I met a lot of wonderful people online. I joined a few WordPress groups, but mainly the StudioPress forum because I had been using their free themes when they were Revolution Two. Then they developed the Genesis Framework. Their old forum was a gold mine of information and the people were awesome. I learned so much from that forum.</p>\n<p>Every day from that point on was WordPress and Genesis. Meeting more people, learning more code. I was completely off the grid in that hotel room! No one here even knew where I was that’s how far off the grid I was. But sometimes, you must do that in order to focus and get back on track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were a lot of bumps in that road the first year, too many to even write out in this essay, but I learned something from each bump.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My business grew from word-of-mouth, I started getting work from people who needed help who saw me on social media and through the forums. Work from people all over the world. It truly was exciting.</p>\n<p>Each day is still WordPress and websites. Learning new things every day. Sitting with Slack windows open and chatting with other WordPress people online. It’s been my entire world since 2013 and pretty much my “Saving Grace” because I feel like I know some people online better than people right here in the same city where I live at. I lived in the hotel for 2 years. Not because I had to but because I wanted to.</p>\n<h3>The Power of Communiity</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community is awesome and giving. The Genesis community is the same. It feels like family and I’ve never met anyone in person but care so much about the people! I would hope that those who know me would feel the same.</p>\n<p>A friend recently shared a quote by the author Dodinsky that started off, “A lot of walking away will do your life good.” But it was the end that really caught my attention and it said, “The more you walk away from things that poison your soul, the healthier your life will be.”</p>\n<p>And that is so true. Healthier in a sense that I walked away from all the bad, negative things and people that were in my space. I was able to grieve and heal. Sometimes bad things that happen to you are good things in disguise.</p>\n<p>What’s in my future? Well, one of my dreams is to get a Sprinter Van, have it customized for living on the road and drive cross country with Bella. Buster passed end of 2016 and Bella is my other life-saver.

More than 100 children (not including parents and guardians) attended this year&#8217;s event. Some of the kids who are more experienced with WordPress shared their experiences during the Kid&#8217;s Panel.  </p>\n<p>Kids reported that they using WordPress for blogs, science projects, and robotic competitions. One fifth grade student, who has been using WordPress for three years, said she plans to continue using it to document her life and share her future educational experiences:</p>\n<p>&#8220;I plan to be using it later in my life when I go to college, so I can be talking about what my life journey was and what I&#8217;m going to be studying, which is software engineering.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Listen to how a 4th grader explains why she likes using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCMIA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCMIA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Zd5cRP3Afg\">pic.twitter.com/Zd5cRP3Afg</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1107290298756009985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Miami to Host New One-Day WordPress Event for Kids and Teachers</h3>\n<p>The growing popularity of WordCamp Miami&#8217;s kids events has inspired organizers to host a new one-day event for kids and teachers. The date has not yet been set but the plan is to have it scheduled for summer 2019. </p>\n<p>The event will be divided into two tracks, one for kids aged 6 to 18 and another for teachers and educators. The kid&#8217;s track will include talks on WordPress, MineCraft, STEAM/STEM activities, and ways they can improve their coding skills. Teachers and educators will have a dedicated track with talks that will help them incorporate coding, WordPress, and broader STEAM/STEM activities into their curricula.</p>\n<p>In their <a href=\"https://2019.miami.wordcamp.org/kids-at-wordcamp-miami-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>, WordCamp Miami&#8217;s organizers said they believe the next generation of WordPress users are &#8220;vital to the growth of the open web.&#8221; They are looking for sponsors to cover the costs of snacks and lunch for approximately 100 students, volunteers and speakers to give presentations on various subjects for kids and teachers, and people to spread the word to schools in the Dade/Broward area.</p>\n<p>Kids engaging with WordPress is one of the most inspiring things happening in the community right now. It&#8217;s the spark of a new generation of users who are embracing the concept of sharing their ideas on the open web. WordPress&#8217; Community team also has a new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/kids-events/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Event Working Group</a> that kicked off last month to support the growth of these kinds of events around the world.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-sniffer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Sniffer</a> plugin is a new effort from the Theme Review team that uses custom sniffs for <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> to test a theme against WordPress coding standards and check for PHP version compatibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/theme-sniffer.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin is useful for both theme reviewers and developers who want to get their themes approved for the WordPress.org directory. It includes several optional standards to test against beyond the ruleset for theme review requirements. Passing the Theme Sniffer checks is not required for themes entering the directory but reviewers can use the plugin to speed the process up.</p>\n<p>The Accessibility Team also published a new tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-theme-auditor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Theme Auditor</a> that runs <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Axe</a> tests against a theme for automated accessibility feedback. Axe is an open source library and testing engine created by the accessibility experts at <a href=\"https://www.deque.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deque</a>. The WP Theme Auditor package can be installed into a theme&#8217;s root directory. Developers can then add test cases. Examples are available in the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-theme-auditor#readme\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">README file</a>. The tests are run against <a href=\"http://one.wordpress.test\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://one.wordpress.test</a> by default but developers can specify a different test environment URL.</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team plans to expand the test cases in the tool to include all the content from the current <a href=\"https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11y-theme-unit-test/blob/master/a11y-theme-unit-test-data.xml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Unit Test Data</a> package. In the most recent team meeting, they decided to recommend WP Theme Auditor as a WordPress testing tool and plan to post more details about it on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">make.wordpress.org/accessibility</a> blog.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 03:42:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: A Quick Introduction to WordPress’ Date/Time Component\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88053\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/a-quick-introduction-to-wordpress-date-time-component\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3109:\"<p>At WordCamp Nordic&#8217;s contributor day I had the opportunity to chat with <a href=\"https://www.rarst.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Andrey &#8220;Rarst&#8221; Savchenko</a> about WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/date-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Date/Time component</a>, the code that manages date, time, and timezone functionality. Savchenko is one of the maintainers of this lesser-known component, which includes code that dates back to PHP 4 times. After volunteering for years in the WordPress Stack Exchange forums, he encountered some of the worst Date/Time bugs, eventually spurring him on to get involved improving the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From there it was a slow descent into the madness of the component,&#8221; Savchenko said. &#8220;Much of my experience ended up in my <a href=\"https://github.com/Rarst/wpdatetime\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WpDateTime library</a>. By last year I was, at last, confident I had a good grasp on the extent of the problem and a way forward for core.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Date/Time issues affect both developers and users. Savchenko said most of the problems, by volume, are related to an incorrect output of localized time by `date_i18n()`. These things can trickle down to users and affect post scheduling, querying, and other operations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of them are outright bugs and some are easy to break due to incompatibility with Unix timestamps,&#8221; Savchenko said. &#8220;But many other parts of the core have problems related to time &#8211; most often around time zones and daylight savings time. Posts can end up with the wrong time, not published when needed, sorted in the wrong order, and so on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The requirement for backwards compatibility makes progress slow but Savchenko and fellow contributors shipped some of their work in the most recent release of WordPress. They will have more solutions available to pursue when the minimum required PHP version is bumped.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In WordPress 5.1 we had shipped a set of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?component=Date%2FTime&milestone=5.1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">important fixes for documentation and some of the worst bugs in `date_i18n()`</a>. </p>\n<p>&#8220;At the moment we continue to work on outstanding issues and get ready to implement <a href=\"https://github.com/Rarst/wp-date/issues/4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a set of major new API functions</a>. The work on the component has also revitalized the discussion of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18146\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introducing user timezones</a>. However I think those need a lot of UX work to reach workable proposal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the video below for a quick overview of the work being done on the Date/Time component and find out how you can get involved at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-datetime\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#core-datetime</a> channel in WordPress Slack.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:04:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: GitHub Is Testing Commits on Behalf of Organizations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88028\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/github-is-testing-commits-on-behalf-of-organizations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2012:\"<p>GitHub users may soon be able to <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2019-03-15-creating-a-commit-on-behalf-of-an-organization/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">contribute to projects on behalf of an organization</a>.

Helen Hou-Sandí, 10up&#8217;s Director of Open Source Initiatives, explained how it works:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You’ll be able to manage your entire development lifecycle in GitHub—no more futzing with local Bash scripts or controlling commit/push access in multiple places. You reference our action in your plugin repo’s workflow file, filtered to only run when a tag is pushed, and set your username/password secrets. After that, each time you tag a new version on GitHub, whether by pushing a Git tag from the command line or making one using the GitHub releases interface, your plugin will be deployed to WordPress.org.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Developers who want to use this Action will need to <a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions/signup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for beta access to GitHub Actions</a> in order to create their own Actions-enabled repo for pushing plugin releases to WordPress.org.

It&#8217;s surrounded by high concrete walls, completely contained. Inside it&#8217;s bustling, lots of honking traffic, people everywhere, the sound is deafening. You see people arguing in bars and chatting on street corners. Billboards and advertisements are everywhere, touting ever kind of good and service. It&#8217;s noisy and dense and overwhelming. </p>\n<p>This is Facebook.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The video also likens Instagram to a cookie cutter housing development that is actually just a collection of billboards with no one living there.</p>\n<p>My expectation before playing the video was that it would enumerate the positive aspects of the open web but I was surprised to find it juxtaposed with Facebook and Instagram in a somewhat jarring fashion midway through. It effectively communicates the stark contrast between the limitations and restrictions of social media silos and the freedom of owning your own website.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Open Web Meditation was created as a design experiment at Automattic that encourages viewers to look beyond the walls of dominant social media platforms and consider how our experiences on the web differ based on where we choose to share our ideas. The company is looking to gain global exposure for the video by <a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/openwebmeditation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inviting people to create their own versions of it in their own languages</a>. </p>\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s video is a timely message, as the world pauses to reflect on the 30th birthday of the World Wide Web this week. In his <a href=\"https://webfoundation.org/2019/03/web-birthday-30/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open letter</a> published by the Web Foundation, Tim Berners-Lee urged companies, governments, and the web&#8217;s citizens not to give up on building a better web. He identified &#8220;system design that creates perverse incentives,&#8221; where user value is sacrificed, as one of the most dangerous threats to the web at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit,&#8221; Berners-Lee said. &#8220;Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right, we will need to come together as a global web community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many commercial entities have enjoyed extraordinary and unprecedented opportunities and influence because of the creation of the world wide web. Berners-Lee underscored their responsibility toward the public as stewards of the open web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind.

The release post credited Simon Scannell of RIPS Technologies for discovering and reporting the vulnerability. Scannell published a <a href=\"https://blog.ripstech.com/2019/wordpress-csrf-to-rce/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> summarizing how an unauthenticated attacker could take over any WordPress site that has comments enabled:</p>\n<blockquote><p>An attacker can take over any WordPress site that has comments enabled by tricking an administrator of a target blog to visit a website set up by the attacker. As soon as the victim administrator visits the malicious website, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) exploit is run against the target WordPress blog in the background, without the victim noticing. The CSRF exploit abuses multiple logic flaws and sanitization errors that when combined lead to Remote Code Execution and a full site takeover.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since WordPress ships with comments enabled by default, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on any site with the default settings. Auto-updates went out yesterday but administrators who have background updates disabled are advised to update immediately.</p>\n<p>The maintenance release also includes the ability for hosts to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46074\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offer a button to prompt their users to update PHP</a> ahead of WordPress&#8217; planned <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">minimum PHP version bump in 5.2</a>.

In August 2018, James submitted a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/30/merge-proposal-dark-mode/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">merge proposal</a> for including Dark Mode in core, but it was shot down the same day it was published. Gary Pendergast said the proposal &#8220;seemed premature&#8221; and noted that the project was lacking several merge criteria outlined on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/features-as-plugins/#feature-plugin-merge-criteria\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Handbook page for feature plugins</a>. He cited a lack of weekly chats, no kickoff and update posts, and no testing from the Flow team, among other concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I decided recently that because of the direction WordPress is going in with the move towards React with Gutenberg that I should probably focus my efforts elsewhere,&#8221; James said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mostly to do with the merge proposal getting rejected fairly quickly without any helpful next steps on how to improve it. Plus, with how rapidly Gutenberg is being developed, I&#8217;d have to pretty much work in tandem with the Gutenberg team to ensure the Dark Mode plugin styled the UI correctly. That&#8217;s spare time I just don&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like WordPress leadership is another reason. It&#8217;s really difficult (I think/feel) to get something like Dark Mode pushed through. It&#8217;s very much near the bottom of the priority list, which I get, but sucks a bit when you&#8217;re volunteering in spare time of course.&#8221; James said the plugin currently requires a few hours per week in support and maintenance.</p>\n<p>The popularity of dark modes for applications has taken off after macOS Mojave introduced a dark mode, and has also been spurred on by the news that Apple&#8217;s 2020 iPhone lineup will be produced with OLED screens. Many popular applications, such as YouTube, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, and Google Maps already have a dark mode that either works automatically based on light conditions or can be manually enabled. Chrome also recently <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9275525\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">added a dark browsing mode for Mac users</a>. Fans of dark mode claim it is <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/night-dark-mode-design\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">easier on the eyes and conserves battery</a>. </p>\n<p>Users who tend to gravitate towards dark mode are still a small subset, but the feature is gaining momentum. A dark mode may one day come to WordPress core but it doesn&#8217;t seem likely in the near future. Daniel James&#8217; Dark Mode plugin isn&#8217;t ready for core, since it doesn&#8217;t support the new editor, but he said he hopes the new owner will find the time to take it where it needs to go. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to transfer the plugin to someone else to continue it, as long as they&#8217;re well known/respected,&#8221; James said. &#8220;I won&#8217;t just be giving it away for security reasons. It would be great for it to be included in core one day, but at the very least it would be nice for someone who really likes it to just continue it.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 22:51:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"HeroPress: Work Life “Balance” With WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2711\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"https://heropress.com/essays/work-life-balance-with-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=work-life-balance-with-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6691:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/031619-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I can’t imagine how I could have ever achieved my goal of integrating family and an impactful career without WordPress.\" /><p>I always knew I wanted to have a career, and I also knew I wanted a family. As my family grew, I realized that a typical job where you have to show up at an office every day didn’t work with the dynamic and unpredictable nature of kids. I didn’t understand why being at a physical office was a requirement: wasn’t the most important thing getting the work done? I could work just as well from home, and the flexibility would mean I could do my work at hours that worked for me. Who cares if I finished a project at 11 pm, if I did it well and on time?</p>\n<h3>Creating Change</h3>\n<p>So after my fourth kid was born, I decided to create that flexibility for myself, and went freelance, but with a vision to grow into a company. That’s why from the beginning I created a brand for my services, and called the “company” illuminea. At first I offered content related services, like marketing writing, and Hebrew to English translation. Increasingly the work I was doing was related to company websites, and the power websites had in terms of communicating messages and content marketing really caught my attention. I also had always been fascinated by technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I started to teach myself how to build websites, using Google as my teacher.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At first I built basic HTML websites, but as I also learned about web marketing I realized that a site that can’t be easily updated is not doing any favors for its owners. Website content needs to be quickly and easily updatable. So I started researching CMS options. Many companies in those days were using expensive and clunky proprietary CMSs, and I was not impressed. I tested the three leading Open Source CMSs, and fell in love with WordPress. I was impressed by the templating system, the plugin ecosystem, and the community.</p>\n<h3>Moving to WordPress</h3>\n<p>At that time companies did not take WordPress seriously as a CMS. Blogging was catching on, so companies would install a WordPress blog as a subdomain, but they weren’t using it for general site management. I thought it could be more, and managed to convince a few clients to let me build their sites on WP.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And then version 3.0 was released, and WP became a full-fledged CMS.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Companies started to become sick of the limitations and costs of their proprietary CMSs, and since I was one of the first in the Israeli market to offer WP as a service, I started to get more and more clients for full website projects.</p>\n<p>Right before I had my fifth kid, I made my first hire: Rebecca Markowitz. I taught her whatever I knew, and she quickly surpassed me with her skills in many areas. We have been working (and laughing) together ever since!</p>\n<p>One thing led to another and illuminea became one of the leading providers of custom WordPress business solutions in Israel. We were privileged to work with inspiring innovators and generally nice people.</p>\n<h3>Building Something New</h3>\n<p>I had had many ideas for products throughout the years, but managing a business and having babies meant I could not realistically build a product on the side. However, after about twelve years of illuminea, and when my youngest was no longer a baby, I had an idea for a WordPress-related product: our clients, and ourselves, were suffering from issues related to speed and security. No matter what we did, we could never speed up client websites as much as they or we would have liked; and no matter what we did on the security side, sites still had vulnerabilities too often. So I thought: why not convert WordPress websites to serverless and static versions of themselves so they’ll be fast and secure?</p>\n<blockquote><p>I decided to go for it. I got accepted to a Jerusalem startup accelerator called Siftech, and they gave me the tools and access to resources and mentors that I needed to take the next steps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I called that venture Strattic, and today we are a venture-backed team of seven with a great product that our clients love.</p>\n<p>I can’t imagine how I could have ever achieved my goal of integrating family and an impactful career without WordPress. To this day I love that I am always challenged and learning more, and always meeting more people in our amazing community, while also having the flexibility I need to be a mom. Of course it’s not perfect, but it’s pretty good, thank God.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Work Life &#8220;Balance&#8221; With WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Work%20Life%20%22Balance%22%20With%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwork-life-balance-with-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Work Life &#8220;Balance&#8221; With WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwork-life-balance-with-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwork-life-balance-with-wordpress%2F&title=Work+Life+%26%238220%3BBalance%26%238221%3B+With+WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Work Life &#8220;Balance&#8221; With WordPress\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\">\n<div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Work Life &#8220;Balance&#8221; With WordPress\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/work-life-balance-with-wordpress/\" title=\"Work Life &#8220;Balance&#8221; With WordPress\"></a></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/work-life-balance-with-wordpress/\">Work Life &#8220;Balance&#8221; With WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 20:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Miriam Schwab\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: Google Announces Season of Docs Program to Match Technical Writers with Open Source Projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://wptavern.com/google-announces-season-of-docs-program-to-match-technical-writers-with-open-source-projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2280:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-12-at-6.13.26-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Google is launching a new program called <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Season of Docs</a> with the goal of fostering collaboration between technical writers and open source projects. The initiative is very similar to <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Summer of Code</a>, except it is focused on documentation and technical writing contributions instead. </p>\n<p>Prospective participants can apply during the month of April 2019. Google plans to publish a list of accepted organizations with their ideas for documentation projects. Technical writers can choose a project and submit a proposal to Season of Docs. The accepted proposals will be published July 30, 2019, and participants will then spend a month bonding with their open source communities and collaborating with mentors. The Season of Docs program officially runs from September 2 &#8211; November 29, and participants will receive a stipend of $2400 &#8211; $6,000 USD, calculated based on <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPINT/Resources/270056-1255977254560/6483625-1338834270350/FVogel_WhatisPurchasingPowerParity.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Purchasing Power Parity</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google&#8217;s Open Source Survey</a> results showed that incomplete or missing documentation was one of the most common problems encountered in open source, observed by 93% of respondents.

The event was held during Contributor Day at the same venue, tucked into a comfortable corner with soft chairs and ample floor space for the kids to stretch out. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/petya/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Petya Raykovska</a> led the workshop and participants followed along with the help of a large screen for demonstrating basic publishing-related tasks. The kids learned how to use the editor, add text and images, create galleries, and customize their sites by selecting a theme. Each participant left the workshop with their own WordPress site hosted at WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like an exercise in creativity, showing them how to use a tool to express themselves on the web,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Teaching kids how to use WordPress is far easier than teaching adults how to use it for the first time, because they don&#8217;t have preconceived notions about how the editor should behave. Raykovska said the group at WordCamp Nordic had no issues using Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter for them what editor they use,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;They are very intuitive; they go along with anything that comes their way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She also reported that many of the kids from past kids workshop events have kept their blogs going and maintain strong relationships with the volunteers who helped them get started. </p>\n<p>Each kids workshop is a new opportunity for organizers to test and refine different methods for teaching kids how to use WordPress. As these workshops become more common at WordCamps around the globe, it would be exciting to see them grow to become large scale events where more experienced kids can present on what they are learning and doing with WordPress. </p>\n<p>If you are interested in running a kids workshop at another WordCamp, Raykovska has created an <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/WordPress-Workshop-for-Kids-organiser-kit-kxmOjjycWysa3jFYoaBTv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">organizer kit</a> for training the next generation of WordPress users and developers.

The directory would make blocks searchable and installable from within the Gutenberg editor. Building a directory for discovering blocks and seamlessly installing them is one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nine projects</a> that Matt Mullenweg identified as a priority for 2019.</p>\n<p>Block collections have become one of the most popular ways for distributing a group of related blocks but this method can cause bloat. Users currently cannot search for individual blocks by name and plugin names and descriptions are not always a good indication of what the blocks do.</p>\n<p>Shiels proposed the new directory be limited to single block plugins, frontend JavaScript blocks with no UI outside of the editor. It would be a separate section inside the Plugins Directory, optimized for users to find blocks by name and description. Developers would be required to use a block.json file with metadata as outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/288853cc57436b0eda17a82f6a58b77e21d5c7ba/docs/rfc/block-registration.md\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Block Registration RFC</a>, which provides a technical specification for block type registration.</p>\n<p>The most controversial part of the proposal is having blocks installable from within the Gutenberg editor. The long term goal is to make that process as seamless as possible. Block collections and blocks that do not meet the requirements of the single block directory would still be available via the normal plugin installation process. This could be confusing for users who do not know that blocks can be found in two separate directories.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Gutenberg editor should NOT be a plugin installation source,&#8221; Matt Cromwell commented on the proposal. &#8220;That just seems ripe for scope-creep. That’s not its purpose or function. Let it be an editor, layout builder, content manager, etc. Moving into searching an external library and installing plugins is the definition of losing site of the purpose of a &#8216;product.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cromwell suggested a centralized block manager as an alternative that would offer a better experience for searching and installing blocks. He also echoed other participants&#8217; opinions on the importance of including dynamic blocks in the directory, instead of limiting it to &#8220;JavaScript only&#8221; blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A centralized Block Manager like has already been suggested is a far better user-experience for searching and installing blocks than doing that in the Gutenberg editor. I like the idea of single-block plugins being the only option in the Directory. But make sure Dynamic Blocks that depend on other existing plugins or outside functionality are able to be added to that very important Directory as well. I really don’t see a benefit to limiting this Directory so much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress developer Jamie Schmid also expressed hesitation about pursuing a solution that puts block installation inside the editor, as it may discourage users from thinking about their block usage across the entire site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am not convinced that making blocks searchable and installable from within the editor is the best solution,&#8221; Schmid said. &#8220;This, along with page level block controls and style overrides, is encouraging a very short-sighted, page-level solution to an issue that is very likely a global site (or content or even business) issue. I’d love to instead see a central view for all installed blocks – similar to how plugins are, but more organized by type/function/etc and with a visual alongside. This will encourage making decisions at the site level, encouraging some bigger-picture reflection. And same to being able to apply access controls to the installation of new blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The proposal would place the single block plugin search interface inside the block inserter in the Gutenberg editor. This would enable users to quickly search for and install a block if they don&#8217;t see one they need among the existing blocks.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/inserter-with-search-results-from-block-dir.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>A mockup of what inline block installation might look like\n<p>Riad Benguella, Gutenberg&#8217;s technical lead for phase 2, encouraged participants in the discussion to think about blocks as pieces of content that do not rely on the post editor but can be configured anywhere inside WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is important to think of blocks as its own unit that have a meaning on its own, and that can be used in different contexts,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;A block is a piece of content (static or dynamic) that can be configured and rendered anywhere.&#8221; This includes blocks found both inside and outside post_content, content in a full site editor, inside the WordPress admin, a headless application, or even another CMS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We should be ambitious and think about all these contexts (the final picture), but at the same time we should be pragmatic and iterate to achieve this goal,&#8221; Benguella said.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new block directory and block plugin architecture continues across WordPress contributor teams. Shiels said the proposal was meant as a starting place and contributors are still in the preliminary stage of exploring ideas.

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote></figure>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"The Month in WordPress: March 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2019/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:59:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:368:\"WordPress reached a significant milestone this month.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release. Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\">PHP 5.6 is going to become the minimum required PHP version for WordPress</a>, a significant step towards a more modern web and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">updated coding standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-2-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in beta</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has received significant performance improvements since WordPress 5.1, shaving 35% off the load time for massive posts, and cutting the keypress time (how responsive it feels when you&#8217;re typing) in half!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility continues to improve, too. The block editor now supports your browser&#8217;s reduced motion settings. The post URL slug has better labelling and help text. The focus styling for keyboard navigating through landmarks is clearer and more consistent. There are a variety of new speak messages, and existing messages have been tweaked for more useful screen-reader behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added several new blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An RSS block</li><li>An Amazon Kindle embed block</li><li>A Search block</li><li>A Calendar block</li><li>A Tag Cloud block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you keep track of these blocks, and only show the ones you need, there&#8217;s a new block management tool to switch blocks on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6806\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Block Management Modal</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on existing blocks, too. There are hundreds of bug fixes and improvements in the block editor, you can read more about them in the Gutenberg plugin releases: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-23th-january/\">4.9</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-february/\">5.0</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/\">5.1</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-march/\">5.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">5.3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The WordPress Mobile Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor isn&#8217;t just for websites, either. The WordPress mobile apps now include an experimental version of a built-in block editor. This is still under development, but you can try it out now!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-make-wordpress-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BEX89Pj6RV\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/\">The block editor is coming to the mobile apps</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;The block editor is coming to the mobile apps&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Mobile\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/embed/#?secret=BEX89Pj6RV\" data-secret=\"BEX89Pj6RV\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phase of this project (originally scoped for WordPress 5.1) is now included in WordPress 5.2. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>). Before, you’d have to FTP in to your files or get in touch with your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ueLxW5eatZ\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">The Improved Fatal Error Protection</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;The Improved Fatal Error Protection&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/embed/#?secret=ueLxW5eatZ\" data-secret=\"ueLxW5eatZ\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we&#8217;re adding a new Health Check tool to your Dashboard. Visit the <em>Tools</em> menu and click on <em>Health Check</em> to get information that can help improve the speed and security of  your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PHP Version Bump</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">WordPress will increase its minimum supported PHP version to 5.6</a>. To help you check if you&#8217;re prepared for this change, WordPress 5.2 will show you a warning and help you upgrade your version of PHP, if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plugins can now specify the minimum version of PHP that they support, so you can safely modernise your development practices without risking breaking your users&#8217; sites. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">#40934</a>)</li><li>We&#8217;ve added the <code>sodium_compat</code> library, which provides backwards compatibility for the <a href=\"https://blog.zend.com/2018/11/06/modern-cryptography-in-php-7-2-with-sodium/\">Sodium-based cryptography library added in PHP 7.2</a>.

The first phase of Gutenberg resulted in the block editor that was included in WordPress 5.0, but development didn’t stop there &#8211; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/\">phase 2 of the project is well underway</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month, one of the initial goals for this phase was reached with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/18/porting-widgets-to-blocks-feb-18-2019/\">all of the core WordPress widgets being converted to blocks</a> &#8211; this will go a long way to allowing full sites to be built using blocks, rather than simply post or page content.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in developing Gutenberg?
