do something different for this world which will be remembered long after I am gone.\" /><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>I was born and brought up in the under-developed city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layyah\">​Layyah​</a>, which is situated in Southern Punjab and surrounded by desert and the river <strong>​Sindh​</strong>.</p>\n<p>I graduated from college in my hometown with pretty much regular grades. Went through some hard times when I was in university. It was also difficult for me to pay the university dues due to financial shortcomings.</p>\n<p>I am a sportsman and still have a wish to play in International Cricket which seems impossible from where I am today. At one point, I wished to join Pakistan Air Force but life directed me towards Computer Sciences.</p>\n<p>I started using a computer in ​2010​ when I joined <a href=\"https://gcuf.edu.pk/\">​Government College University Faisalabad​</a>. Came to know about WordPress while I was finishing the last semester of my degree and my FYP was based on WordPress.</p>\n<p>My mother&#8211;who is no more in this world&#8211;was the real hero of my life and stayed by my side till her last breath. I remember my kindergarten days when she helped me with my homework. I remember the moments in which she used to stay standing in front of the house while I drove off to school.</p>\n<p>I remember her last day at the hospital. I met her in the ICU before her heart surgery. She hugged me and said ​“<strong>Don’t worry, everything will be good</strong>”​. She expired during the surgery. I pray for her soul to rest in peace every day.</p>\n<h3>Start of Career:</h3>\n<p>Something had always felt missing in my life, but I felt like I was on the right track for the first time in my life when I joined the WordPress community. After graduation, I struggled a lot to get my first job. I joined <a href=\"https://www.presstigers.com/\">​PressTigers​</a> as a Software Engineer and continued struggling to make my position better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FahadShakeel\">Khawaja Fahad Shakeel​</a> was my first mentor. For me, it has always been an honour to work with him. He directed me towards the right path and provided me with endless support.</p>\n<h3>Community &#8211; WordCamps and Meetups:</h3>\n<p>I am using WordPress since ​2015​. Once I started attending meetups and open source contribution, it turned out to be a game changer for me.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>I learned a lot of things from the WordPress Community platform. There are a lot of personalities who have left a deep impression on met. One of them is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jainnidhi03\">​Nidhi Jain​</a> from Udaipur India. At this point, she is like a sister to me. We have an amazing chemistry when it comes to working on WordPress dev. The second one is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/desrosj\">​Jonathan Desrosiers​</a> who is like my big brother whom I have learned a lot from and continue to do more every day.</p>\n<p>WordPress Community is where I feel the most comfortable, after my family. I am supporting local WordPress communities and was part of ​WordCamp Karachi​ as an organizer. It was the first time that I spoke in an international level event.</p>\n<p>People around the globe know me because of WordPress. This is why WordPress is my identity. I owe a huge part of who I am to the WordPress Community.</p>\n<h3>WordPress and Future:</h3>\n<p>I believe WordPress can never die as long as people don’t stop baking new things and curating it according to the demands of the new era.</p>\n<p><em>The beauty of WordPress is that it is made for everyone.</em></p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Lahore/members/?op=leaders&sort=name\">​co-organizer of WordPress Meetup Lahore​</a> it is an honor for me to provide a platform for people to gather under one roof, to learn and share something with the community. I believe in diversity and would love to involve more people in the community leadership team.</p>\n<p>I am extremely hopeful regarding the WordPress Meetup Lahore group and welcome everyone to contribute into making it great.</p>\n<p>I have been terribly impressed by <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">​Marcel​</a> as he walked for WC Europe and I would love to walk for WC Asia after the approval.</p>\n<p>In the future, if I get a chance in politics, I wish to be a part of upper house as a <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov.pk/\">​SENATOR OF PAKISTAN​</a>. Hopefully, I will be contesting in the next senate election either from the platform of the ruling party or as an independent candidate.</p>\n<h3>Community Mentor:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Usman__Khalid\">Usman Khalid​</a>, the lead organizer of WC Karachi, is the hero behind the scenes for establishing the communities in Pakistan. He has mentored me for community relevant stuff. I would love to credit him, the person who gathered the Pakistani WordPress folks under one roof for the first time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Message for WordPressers:</h3>\n<p><em>If you seriously want to do something for yourself, do something for others first.</em></p>\n<p>Go for open source, you’ll surely learn how to code. You’ll learn how to work in a team. Join local meetups, meet with the folks: help them, learn from them and share ideas.</p>\n<h3>Wrap Up:</h3>\n<p>One thing I have learned from life is that there is no shortcut to success. You have to work hard to achieve your goals. The person who lives in a fantasy world will never succeed in life.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I have achieved something great. I still have the thirst to do something; lots and lots of missions to be accomplished. My only wish is to do something different for this world which will be remembered long after I am gone.</p>\n<p>Together we grow.

The company received 33,478 responses from developers across 23 industries and 194 countries and territories. Twenty-two languages were represented and less than half of respondents spoke English (47.13%), although the survey was in English.</p>\n<p>The preview highlights essential trends in the JavaScript ecosystem. React&#8217;s growing popularity is the least surprising among these trends. The results showed that 63% of respondents are using React.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-3.15.32-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>npm Inc. estimates that there are approximately 5 million React developers worldwide and concludes that &#8220;There has never been a JavaScript framework this popular before, and it is more than twice as popular as the next-biggest framework, Angular.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Results for other frameworks are not yet available to the public but npm Inc. plans to share more details in future articles. </p>\n<p>Nearly half (49%) of respondents have more than 5 years of experience using JavaScript, a 9% increase from the previous year&#8217;s survey, shifting an estimated 1 million participants into this category. This indicates that the JavaScript user base is becoming more sophisticated overall. </p>\n<p>Another trend is the rising popularity of GraphQL. While its adoption is still relatively low, with only 7% of respondents indicating that they use it frequently, 23% of developers use it for some of their projects. The results showed that 72% of npm users are using or considering using GraphQL in 2019.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-4.36.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In a post that goes further in depth on <a href=\"https://medium.com/npm-inc/methodology-of-the-2018-2019-javascript-ecosystem-survey-and-results-b1cef1b83f10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the methodology used for the survey</a>, nmp Inc. said the company did not collect demographics on race or gender identity, so the data may not be representative of the broader population of JavaScript users on these metrics.

NetBeans joins more than 350 other open source projects and initiatives managed by the foundation after spending two years in the Apache Incubator.</p>\n<p>The IDE supports Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, and other popular programming languages, and is also used as a tooling platform and application framework. Although PhpStorm and Sublime Text capture a larger share of the IDE market for PHP developers, there is a small but passionate segment of WordPress developers who favor NetBeans as their IDE of choice.</p>\n<p>NetBeans started as a student project in 1996 in what was formerly known as Czechoslovakia. It was the first Java IDE written in Java but it soon became more than just an IDE platform, as the community began using it to create applications that weren&#8217;t development tools. In 2000, Sun Microsystems acquired NetBeans and open sourced it, making it Sun&#8217;s first sponsored open source project. It became part of Oracle when it acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 and the company continues to sponsor the project. NetBeans is now used by more than 1.5 million users each month.</p>\n<p>Now that Apache NetBeans is governed by the ASF, it will be more likely to receive contributions than when it belonged to a commercial entity. However, contributors from Oracle and other organizations will continue to be part of shaping its future. Coming under the ASF umbrella is also bringing some welcome developments for the project&#8217;s governance, according to Apache NetBeans Vice President Geertjan Wielenga:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being part of the ASF means that NetBeans is now not only free and Open Source software: it is also, uniquely, and for the first time, part of a foundation specifically focused on enabling open governance. Every contributor to the project now has equal say over the roadmap and direction of NetBeans. That is a new and historic step and the community has been ready for this for a very long time. Thanks to the strong stewardship of NetBeans in Sun Microsystems and Oracle, Apache NetBeans is now ready for the next phase in its development and we welcome everyone to participate as equals as we move forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oracle&#8217;s decision to submit NetBeans to the ASF Incubator came as a surprise to many in 2016. At that time, OSI President Simon Phipps <a href=\"https://meshedinsights.com/2016/09/15/oracle-gets-it-right-netbeans-heads-to-apache/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared his thoughts</a> about the benefits he saw for the project moving to open governance under the ASF:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By moving to independent governance and losing the Oracle CLA, others can join in with confidence their contribution won’t be used against them. More importantly, contributors also no longer need fear the transient decisions of cost-cutting Oracle VPs impacting the long-term viability of the project. Oracle’s Java team still needs NetBeans in order to make tools releases supporting new capabilities in Java 9 and later, so are likely to engage. Rather than withdrawal, this looks more like leveraging the ecosystem around NetBeans to sustain development while keeping Oracle’s costs in line with the direct benefit NetBeans delivers to them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/NetBeansProposal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> submitted to the ASF for NetBeans&#8217; acceptance into the Incubator, the majority of code contributions have come from Oracle since it acquired Sun Microsystems. In addressing some of the known risks Oracle faces in contributing NetBeans to the ASF, the proposal states that &#8220;the size and diversity of the community is a guarantee against the project being orphaned.&#8221; </p>\n<p>NetBean&#8217;s proposal said the purpose of moving NetBeans to Apache is to &#8220;expand the diversity of contributors and to increase the level of meritocracy.&#8221; The project already has a good foundation to build on, as its application framework is used by large companies and organizations, including Boeing, Airbus Defense and Space, NASA, and NATO, that depend on NetBeans for building mission critical scientific software. This new era of open governance should give the community a stronger sense of ownership and stimulate greater levels of contribution across the project. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 02:18:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6909\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3119:\"<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone as we progress toward the WordPress 5.2 release date. “Release Candidate” means that the new version is ready for release, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible something was missed.

However, more than half of all WordPress users (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~55%</a>) are not running version 5.0+. Nearly 30% are hanging back at 4.9 and 25% are on even older versions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-23-at-10.05.35-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a> </p>\n<p>Theme authors who create products that have Gutenberg-only features are not yet building for the majority of WordPress users. These authors are carving a path for the future of theme development. The Clean Blocks theme doesn&#8217;t really fall into this category, as its essentially enables users on WordPress 5.0+ to continue using the new editor without any styling issues. It is also compatible with earlier versions of WordPress (4.8+).</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks recommends a collection of Catch Themes&#8217; functionality plugins upon theme activation. These plugins handle things like galleries, infinite scroll, Instagram feeds, widgets, and additional content types. The theme includes dozens of options in the Customizer for controlling nearly every aspect of how content is displayed &#8211; from excerpt length to categories displayed on the home page to header text color. This sort of overloaded Customizer options panel is common for multipurpose style themes, and many users have come to expect it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/demo/clean-blocks-free/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out a demo</a> of the free version to see all the features in action.</p>\n<p>The name &#8220;Clean Blocks&#8221; implies that the theme goes beyond the basics to customize the Gutenberg experience, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. The vast majority of the features seen in the demo are controlled by the Customizer. For example, features like Testimonials and Services are not available as blocks. While some theme authors opt to integrate features like this by pairing their themes with block collection plugins, Catch Themes has put everything into the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Even with Gutenberg compatibility, many themes still have a disconnect between the back and frontend where certain features can only be configured in the Customizer. This fractured customization experience is one of the necessary evils for this transition time before the block editor is fully capable of handling more complex aspects of site customization.</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks is an example of a multipurpose theme that is essentially keeping it old school in terms of content customization, while providing basic Gutenberg compatibility for users who are running WordPress 5.0+. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/clean-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on WordPress.org</a> and has already been downloaded several hundred times during its first week in the directory. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 22:46:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Laraberg, a Gutenberg Implementation for Laravel, is Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89058\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3953:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The family of Gutenberg derivatives is expanding with the beta release of <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg</a>, an implementation for Laravel. <a href=\"http://mauricewijnia.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Wijnia</a>, a developer at <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, an agency based in Amsterdam, created Laraberg as an easy way for developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor. It includes a simple API and support for the <a href=\"https://unisharp.github.io/laravel-filemanager/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel File Manager</a> for uploading files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal for Laraberg is to give developers the ability to add the Gutenberg editor to any page they like in a way that is as easy as possible, but at the same time it has to prove enough options to tailor the editor so it can fit into any Laravel project out there,&#8221; Wijnia said.</p>\n<p>Van Ons has a <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/nieuws/gutenberg-in-laravel-hier-is-laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preference for using Laravel</a> in their projects, due to its increasing popularity and active community. Laraberg makes it possible for the agency to tap into the convenience of the Gutenberg editor without giving up the performance and features they enjoy in the Laravel framework. The beta release is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/van-ons/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pacagist</a>. Van Ons plans to actively implement Laraberg in their own projects and will also be collecting feedback from beta testers. </p>\n<p>Wijnia said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project, whose creators also authored <a href=\"https://github.com/front/gutenberg-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg.js</a>, a package that makes it easier to bring Gutenberg into other applications. Providing a foundation for using Gutenberg on any CMS or framework is part of Frontkom&#8217;s long term vision for improving the open web and enabling communities to collaborate on mutually beneficial extensions.</p>\n<p>As the editor continues to expand to more platforms and frameworks, a CMS-agnostic block library would offer a central place for Gutenberg&#8217;s increasingly diverse user base to discover new blocks. WordPress.org has the opportunity to provide that in its own block library, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/#comment-8947\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with the support of the Gutenberg Cloud team</a> that pioneered the idea in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Gutenberg Cloud can serve as a proof of concept that WP.org can later adopt as their own, we are happy,&#8221; Frontkom CTO Per Andre Rønsen said. He also further commented on the WordPress.org Block Library proposal, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-cloud-team-advocates-for-making-wordpress-orgs-new-block-directory-a-cms-agnostic-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advocating for the team to grow their vision beyond the WordPress community</a> only. No official decision has been announced yet. If WordPress decides to forgo the opportunity of providing a block library inclusive of other frameworks and platforms, then the Gutenberg Cloud will continue to be the place for discovering blocks that can be used across multiple platforms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:24:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30665:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Be the person you needed when you were younger.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#pt-br\">Este ensaio também está disponível em português.</a></p>\n<p>As I make a checklist of all the things I’ll have to pack to travel from São Paulo to Berlin, to attend WordCamp Europe 2019, I can&#8217;t stop thinking how hard the path to this point has been.</p>\n<p>For some of people, a travel like this may seem ordinary, but for me, this will be the farthest I&#8217;ve ever been until now, in many ways. Especially because the last time I was planning to attend an international WordCamp, things didn&#8217;t work out at all.</p>\n<p>So let me tell you about the path.</p>\n<h3>The first steps</h3>\n<p>I was born and raised in São Paulo. Allow me to give you some context about my city. São Paulo is the richest and biggest city of Brazil. With more than 14 million people, it&#8217;s also the biggest city of the south hemisphere. It&#8217;s even bigger than New York.</p>\n<p>Like every big city, São Paulo is a place of opportunities, but also a place of contrasts.</p>\n<p>Growing up, although we were poor, my family cared a lot about the education of me and my little brother. My father who always liked technology, managed to get a computer for us in 1996. At that time, I was 6 years old, and we were the only family in my neighborhood to have a computer for a long time, and that was sad. That early exposure to technology made a big difference in my life.</p>\n<p>At age 13, I was very interested in graphic design and coding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a very limited and expensive dial-up internet, that was only free after midnight and at weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So to learn these skills, my best options were the CD-ROM magazines that my father would bring home. I also learned about HTML with a book about Microsoft Front Page. At age 14 I sold my first website, entirely created on Front Page, with lots of GIFs and &lt;marquee&gt; tags, for a neighbour who needed it for a college project. She loved it!</p>\n<p>I decided I wanted to work with design. So I started a Graphic Design course during the high school. With my love for web design, all I wanted was to have a site that was actually online. I couldn’t afford a host, but fortunately at this time, blogs became very popular here in Brazil.</p>\n<p>I looked for a platform to create a portfolio. I played a little with one called WordPress (you may have heard of it) and ended up using Blogger instead, because there was the possibility to customize the theme’s CSS online. I made a very dark grungy theme for my blog that’s still online.</p>\n<h3>A bumpy road</h3>\n<p>I got a scholarship for Graphic Design at a good College in São Paulo, but I still would have to pay for half of the monthly tuition. The problem was that my family definitely had no means to afford it. My parents said they would cut some expenses and help me, but I knew that there wasn’t anything they could cut. So I told them to not worry, I would find a job.</p>\n<p>At this point I had made a freelance gig creating a HTML website (in Dreamweaver this time). With exactly 1 month left for the College application, this client proposed that I started working there to maintain the website I just made. So I was able to (barely) pay for the college. After six months, I applied for a full scholarship and it was granted. Things got a little better financially, but the path was still rocky.</p>\n<p>It took me 3 hours by bus from my house to the college every single day, just inside the city of São Paulo (remember when I said this city is huge?).</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had the cheapest hot dog for lunch every day, because I couldn’t afford a real meal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then I would go to work (another 1h30 of bus from the college), and at night I would head back home (another bus, another 1h30). That was my routine for one and a half year throughout the college. As you can imagine, I was exhausted, and eventually getting ill.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>That’s when I decided that I would quit my job and start a business with my boyfriend Allyson Souza, that I met during my Graphic Design course in High School. We started the company officially in july, 2009. <a href=\"http://www.hastedesign.com.br/\">We named it Haste</a> (the portuguese word for “stem”).</p>\n<p>We were 19 years old, not much experience, zero network and money, a lot of energy, and some extra self-confidence (I could have summarized simply as “millennials”, right?). Allyson’s father gave us a computer and a part of his office, for which I am very grateful, and we created all the graphic materiais for his courses company in exchange.</p>\n<p>We started working with graphic design only, and it took us some time to realize that web development was our future.</p>\n<p>I remembered WordPress and tried it again. I liked how the platform had evolved. We made a second version of our website in WordPress, using a simple free theme, which I edited the CSS directly (oh god). We tried to create websites for clients modifying existing themes (at least we learned about child themes later), but we definitely didn’t feel in control of what we were doing.</p>\n<h3>When you hit your lowest point</h3>\n<p>In January 2011, my mother had a stroke. She had a brain surgery, and after a month, she was back home with a 6 inches scar in the head. That was the lowest point on my path.</p>\n<p>The next years I had to take care of her, because of some consequences of the stroke, both physical and psychological. As the only family member who hadn’t a “formal” job, with a boss and a defined schedule, I was the one who had to take her to appointments, or the ER, or stay home when she wasn’t ok. It was very hard to reconcile the final year of college, the work and my mom’s health care.</p>\n<h3>The only way is up</h3>\n<p>At Haste, we felt that things were not evolving. In 2013, after some partnerships that took us to some confusing paths, we decided to have a complete makeover. We defined a new focus: web design and development with WordPress. We created a new website, with a theme fully developed by us. We wanted to overcome the fear of coding, and wanted to know exactly what we were doing. So we started studying a lot by ourselves.</p>\n<p>Allyson was responsible for the PHP and JavaScript and I was supposed to make the design, the HTML and CSS. He started to ask a lot of questions in the group of WordPress Brasil community at Facebook. We finished the website, and people loved it, specially the illustration with parallax effect that made the girl move her eyes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were proud WordPress developers now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We started attending the meetups, and then the WordCamp. I was amazed how the open-source culture was all about sharing knowledge with strangers, with no fear of competition, just the spirit of collaboration. We felt no longer isolated. We made real friends (shout out to all my WordPress friends).</p>\n<p>Soon we were both involved in the community, and became WordCamp São Paulo organizers in 2014.</p>\n<p>The new website and our participation in the WordPress community were really what we needed to give us some perspective and stability. So we didn’t stop there.</p>\n<h3>Bring others to walk with you</h3>\n<p>In the 2014 edition of WordCamp São Paulo, I was the only female speaker. That made me realize a few things.</p>\n<p>First that the proportion of men in the community events was not only the majority but, we almost didn’t had any women at all, which was very weird.</p>\n<p>Second, we know that lots of girls feel intimidated in an environment with too much men. I always had a majority of male friends since I was a kid, and even so, I probably wouldn’t get involved with the community if it wasn’t by the fact that my boyfriend / partner was with me.</p>\n<p>A few sexists incidents had happened with me too. I reacted, and the men involved seemed to understand that I wasn’t ok, and changed their behavior as far as I know.</p>\n<p>We don’t have as many meetups and WordCamps here in Brazil as in US. Although Brazil is becoming a technology hub, the WordPress community has still a lot of room to grow, compared to other communities. So, I think we have the opportunity to make things different while everything is not settled yet.</p>\n<p>So I decided to act now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started a poll asking the women involved with WordPress the reasons why they wouldn’t attend the events. The results proved it wasn’t just me complaining about small things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some jokes kept women away. Some condescending actions made them feel diminished. And even the lack of information from our part, that the WordCamps are inclusive events, made the women not to come. The lack of time, was an important factor too.</p>\n<p>Based on this data, the next year we managed to increase the proportion of female speakers from 5% to 32% at WordCamp São Paulo 2015. More women became organizers too. In 2019 we have 4 women out of 10 active organizers. The last WordCamp we had blind people attending, and their feedback was great. We still need to improve racial diversity though.</p>\n<h3>Barriers and frontiers</h3>\n<p>In 2015, Allyson had told me about this new scholarship program from the WordPress Foundation for women who work for equality in the community around the world. So I applied for the very first Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship. Kim Parsell left a beautiful legacy of inclusion and love, having worked to bring more women, older people, and other minorities to the WordPress community. She was known as the #WPMom.</p>\n<p>The result came few months later. I received an email, and had no reaction for a few minutes. I had won the scholarship, and it granted me a travel to WordCamp US 2015, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, with flights and hotel covered.</p>\n<p>You see: I had never left my country. I had just took flight for the first time that same year. I was not even close to dream to go to US, because it was impossible for me at the moment. Sometimes your mindset in the only thing putting limitations in your dreams.</p>\n<p>I was so happy, you have no idea. Alx Block and Cami Kaos reached to me to give me instructions and they were very kind.</p>\n<p>But then… my visa application was denied. They considered my sudden passport and visa solicitation, with no money to travel (that’s exactly the point of a scholarship!), and lack “ties” in Brazil very suspicious. I told them that the WordPress Foundation would pay for everything. The flights and the hotel were already booked. The officer even told me that the WordPress Foundation letter could be easily forged. I tried again, with no success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2015.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2016 too, when they asked if I wanted to try again, and my visa was denied&#8230; again. This time I think at least the officer searched online for me, saw it was true, but couldn’t do anything, since my situation hadn’t change.</p>\n<p>I was so disappointed. This still hurts me, I must confess. Sometimes, there are real barriers and gates that a simple mindset change cannot open.</p>\n<h3>Crossed paths</h3>\n<p>The next years, I focused on my company and the work at the community. My mom’s health improved, she’s in great shape now. My family supports my work.</p>\n<p>We became specialists in WordPress at Haste. We developed themes, plugins and sites for companies in Brazil and America. I now have a stable income and I live exclusively from my work with WordPress. We are celebrating 10 years in 2019.</p>\n<p>I traveled through Brazil because of WordPress, to speak at WordCamps and Meetups. I see more and more women working with WordPress, attending meetups and WordCamps, and talking to each other, finding something familiar in every other woman’s face.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last year we decided we would go to WordCamp Europe 2019 in Berlin, since we don’t need a visa to most countries there, including Germany.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This time I can afford it (with a lot of planning and expenses cut, but I’ll be ok). I have to confess that I’m a little anxious about the immigration process.</p>\n<p>My goal at WordCamp Europe is to know the most people I can. It’s not a matter of quantity, but if the WordPress community taught me something was that every person has something to teach and to learn. So If you are attending WordCamp Europe, let’s meet!</p>\n<h3>Opening trails</h3>\n<p>So now I hope you can see what this travel really means to me, and why every small conquest means a lot. It’s not just because it was hard. But because I’m not the only one who deserve it, but unfortunately I’m a exception between other people who have the same background as I.</p>\n<p>There are so many young girls and boys that don’t dare to dream about visiting other countries, or even getting in the college. Lots of kids that don’t have a computer, or even access to internet. The only difference is that I was given opportunities, people believed in me. Doors were opened. And just then I could prove my value.</p>\n<p>Now my next dream is to be able to make the journey a little easier than it was for me, specially for women and young Brazilians. Because I think that’s our responsibility in the community. Teach others, share information, donate some of your time, create new tools, plugins and resources, mentor people. As my brother’s tattoo says, be the person you needed when you were younger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pt-br\">Como a comunidade WordPress me ajudou a encontrar o meu caminho</h2>\n<p>Enquanto faço uma lista de todas as coisas que preciso para viajar de São Paulo para Berlim, para participar do WordCamp Europe 2019, não posso deixar de pensar no quão difícil foi o caminho até esse ponto.</p>\n<p>Para algumas pessoas, uma viagem como essa pode parecer comum, mas, para mim, esse será o mais longe que já fui até agora, de muitas maneiras. Especialmente porque, da última vez que eu planejava participar de um WordCamp internacional, as coisas não deram certo.</p>\n<p>Então deixe-me contar sobre esse caminho.</p>\n<h3>Os primeiros passos</h3>\n<p>Eu nasci e cresci em São Paulo. Permita-me dar um pouco de contexto sobre minha cidade. São Paulo é a mais rica e maior cidade do Brasil. Com mais de 14 milhões de pessoas, é também a maior cidade do hemisfério sul. É maior que Nova York.</p>\n<p>Como toda grande cidade, São Paulo é um lugar de oportunidades, mas também de contrastes.</p>\n<p>Crescendo, apesar de sermos pobres, minha família se importava muito com a minha educação e do meu irmão mais novo. Meu pai, que sempre gostou de tecnologia, conseguiu um computador para nós em 1996. Naquela época, eu tinha 6 anos, e éramos a única família das redondezas a ter um computador por um longo tempo, e isso era triste. Essa exposição precoce à tecnologia fez uma grande diferença na minha vida.</p>\n<p>Aos 13 anos, eu já estava interessada em design gráfico e programação. Nós tínhamos aquela internet discada muito limitada e cara, que só era gratuita depois da meia-noite e nos fins de semana. Então, para aprender essas habilidades, minhas melhores opções eram as revistas em CD-ROM que meu pai trazia para casa. Eu também aprendi sobre HTML com um livro sobre o Microsoft Front Page. Aos 14 anos, vendi meu primeiro site, inteiramente criado no Front Page, com muitos GIFs e tags &lt;marquee&gt;, para uma vizinha que precisava para um projeto da faculdade. Ela adorou!</p>\n<p>Eu decidi que queria trabalhar com design. Então fiz o curso técnico em design gráfico durante o ensino médio. Com o meu interesse pelo web design, tudo o que eu queria era ter um site que estivesse online. Eu não podia pagar um servidor, mas felizmente, neste momento, os blogs se tornaram muito populares aqui no Brasil.</p>\n<p>Procurei uma plataforma para criar um portfólio. Eu brinquei um pouco com uma plataforma chamada WordPress (você pode ter ouvido falar dela) mas acabei usando o Blogger, porque havia a possibilidade de personalizar o CSS do tema online. Eu fiz um tema escuro e grunge para o meu blog que ainda está online.</p>\n<h3>Uma estrada esburacada</h3>\n<p>Consegui uma bolsa de Design Gráfico em uma boa faculdade em São Paulo, mas ainda teria que pagar metade da mensalidade. O problema era que minha família definitivamente não tinha como arcar com isso. Meus pais disseram que cortariam algumas despesas e me ajudariam, mas eu sabia que não havia nada que pudessem cortar. Então eu disse a eles para não se preocuparem, eu encontraria um emprego.</p>\n<p>Neste momento, eu havia feito um trabalho freelancer criando um site HTML (no Dreamweaver desta vez). Com exatamente 1 mês para o aplicativo da faculdade, esta cliente propôs que eu começasse a trabalhar lá para manter o site que tinha acabado de criar. Então eu pude pagar pela faculdade (bem mal). Depois de seis meses, solicitei uma bolsa de estudos integral e ela foi concedida. As coisas melhoraram um pouco financeiramente, mas o caminho ainda era rochoso.</p>\n<p>Levava 3 horas de ônibus da minha casa para a faculdade todos os dias, apenas dentro da cidade de São Paulo (lembra quando eu disse que essa cidade é enorme?). Eu comia um cachorro-quente mais barato para o almoço todos os dias, porque eu não podia pagar uma refeição de verdade. Então eu ia trabalhar (outra 1h30 de ônibus da faculdade), e à noite eu voltava para casa (outro ônibus, outro 1h30). Essa foi a minha rotina por um ano e meio durante a faculdade. Como você pode imaginar, eu estava exausta e ficando doente.</p>\n<h3>Uma bifurcação no caminho</h3>\n<p>Foi então que decidi largar meu trabalho e começar um negócio com meu namorado Allyson Souza, que conheci durante o curso de Design Gráfico no Ensino Médio. Nós começamos a empresa oficialmente em julho de 2009. Nós a nomeamos Haste.</p>\n<p>Nós tínhamos 19 anos de idade, não muita experiência, zero networking e dinheiro, muita energia e alguma autoconfiança extra (eu poderia ter resumido simplesmente como “millennials”, certo?). O pai do Allyson nos deu um computador e uma parte de seu escritório, pelo que sou muito grata, e criamos todos os materiais gráficos para sua empresa de cursos em troca.</p>\n<p>Começamos a trabalhar apenas com design gráfico e levamos algum tempo para perceber que o desenvolvimento web era o nosso futuro.</p>\n<p>Lembrei-me do WordPress e tentei novamente. Eu gostei de como a plataforma evoluiu. Fizemos uma segunda versão do nosso site no WordPress, usando um simples tema gratuito, que eu editei diretamente o CSS (não façam isso!). Tentamos criar websites para clientes que modificando temas existentes (pelo menos aprendemos sobre temas filhos mais tarde), mas definitivamente não nos sentíamos no controle do que estávamos fazendo.</p>\n<h3>Quando você atinge seu ponto mais baixo</h3>\n<p>Em janeiro de 2011, minha mãe teve um AVC. Ela fez uma cirurgia no cérebro, e depois de um mês, ela estava em casa com uma cicatriz na cabeça. Esse foi o ponto mais baixo do meu caminho.</p>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes eu tive que cuidar dela, por causa de algumas consequências do AVC, tanto físicas quanto psicológicas. Como a única pessoa da família que não tinha um emprego “formal”, com um chefe e um horário de trabalho definido, fui eu quem teve que levá-la às consultas, ao pronto-socorro ou ficar em casa quando ela não estava bem. Foi bem difícil conciliar o último ano da faculdade, o trabalho e cuidar da saúde da minha mãe.</p>\n<h3>O único caminho é para cima</h3>\n<p>Na Haste, sentimos que as coisas não estavam evoluindo. Em 2013, após algumas parcerias que nos levaram a caminhos confusos, decidimos fazer uma reformulação completa. Definimos um novo foco: web design e desenvolvimento com WordPress. Criamos um novo site, com um tema totalmente desenvolvido por nós. Queríamos superar o medo de programar e queríamos saber exatamente o que estávamos fazendo. Então começamos a estudar muito por conta própria.</p>\n<p>Allyson ficou responsável pelo PHP e JavaScript e eu deveria fazer o design, o HTML e CSS. Ele começou a postar muitas perguntas no grupo da comunidade WordPress Brasil no Facebook. Nós terminamos o site, e as pessoas adoraram, especialmente a ilustração com efeito de paralaxe que fez a garota mover seus olhos. Nós éramos orgulhosos desenvolvedores do WordPress agora.</p>\n<p>Nós começamos a frequentar os meetups, e depois o WordCamp da comunidade WordPress. Fiquei espantada com a forma como a cultura de código aberto era toda sobre compartilhar conhecimento com estranhos, sem medo de competir, apenas o espírito de colaboração. Não nos sentíamos mais isolados. Nós fizemos amigos de verdade (alô amigos do WordPress).</p>\n<p>Logo nos envolvemos na comunidade e nos tornamos organizadores do WordCamp São Paulo em 2014.</p>\n<p>O novo site e nossa participação na comunidade WordPress foram realmente o que precisávamos para nos dar alguma perspectiva e estabilidade. Então nós não paramos por aí.</p>\n<h3>Traga os outros para caminhar com você</h3>\n<p>Na edição de 2014 do WordCamp São Paulo, eu era a única palestrante mulher. Isso me fez perceber algumas coisas.</p>\n<p>Primeiro, a proporção de homens nos eventos da comunidade não era apenas a maioria, mas quase não tínhamos nenhuma mulher. O que era muito estranho.</p>\n<p>Em segundo lugar, sabemos que muitas mulheres se sentem intimidadas em um ambiente com muitos homens. Eu sempre tive a maioria de amigos homens desde criança, e mesmo assim, eu provavelmente não me envolveria com a comunidade se não fosse pelo fato de meu namorado / sócio estar comigo.</p>\n<p>Alguns incidentes sexistas também aconteceram comigo. Eu reagi, e os homens envolvidos parecem ter entendido o problema, e mudaram seus comportamentos até onde eu sei.</p>\n<p>Não temos tantos meetups e WordCamps aqui no Brasil como nos EUA. Embora o Brasil esteja lentamente se tornando um polo de tecnologia, a comunidade WordPress ainda tem muito espaço para crescer, em comparação com outras comunidades. Então, acho que temos a oportunidade de fazer as coisas diferentes enquanto tudo ainda não está definido.</p>\n<p>Então eu decidi mudar isso.</p>\n<p>Eu comecei uma pesquisa perguntando às mulheres envolvidas com WordPress quais eram as razões pelas quais elas não compareciam aos eventos. Os resultados provaram que não era só eu reclamando de pequenas coisas.</p>\n<p>Algumas piadas mantinham as mulheres afastadas. Algumas ações condescendentes fizeram com que se sentissem diminuídas. E mesmo a falta de informação de nossa parte, de que os WordCamps são eventos inclusivos, fez com que as mulheres não viessem. A falta de tempo também foi um fator importante.</p>\n<p>Com base nesses dados, no ano seguinte conseguimos aumentar a proporção de mulheres palestrantes de 5% para 32% no WordCamp São Paulo 2015. Mais mulheres se tornaram organizadoras também. Em 2019, temos 4 mulheres de 10 organizadores ativos. No último WordCamp, tivemos deficientes visuais comparecendo e o feedback deles foi ótimo. Ainda precisamos melhorar a diversidade racial.</p>\n<h3>Barreiras e fronteiras</h3>\n<p>Em 2015, Allyson me contou sobre o novo programa de bolsas de estudos da Fundação WordPress para mulheres que trabalham pela igualdade na comunidade em todo o mundo. Então me inscrevi para a primeira bolsa Kim Parsell Memorial. Kim Parsell deixou um lindo legado de inclusão e amor, tendo trabalhado para trazer mais mulheres, pessoas mais velhas e outras minorias para a comunidade WordPress. Ela era conhecida como a #WPMom.</p>\n<p>O resultado veio alguns meses depois. Recebi um email e não tive reação por alguns minutos. Eu tinha ganhado a bolsa que me garantia uma viagem para o WordCamp US 2015, na Filadélfia, na Pensilvânia, com voos e hotel cobertos.</p>\n<p>Veja bem: eu nunca tinha saído do meu país. Eu tinha acabado de voar de avião pela primeira vez naquele mesmo ano. Eu não estava nem perto de sonhar em ir para os EUA, porque era impossível para mim no momento. Às vezes sua mentalidade na única coisa colocando limitações em seus sonhos.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão feliz, você não faz ideia. Alx Block e Cami Kaos entraram em contato para me dar instruções e foram muito gentis.</p>\n<p>Mas então&#8230; meu pedido de visto foi negado. Eles consideraram minha solicitação repentina de passaporte e visto, sem dinheiro para viajar (esse é exatamente o ponto de uma bolsa de estudos!),  e a falta de “laços” no Brasil muito suspeitos. Eu disse a eles que a Fundação WordPress pagaria por tudo. Os voos e o hotel já estavam reservados. O oficial até me disse que a carta da Fundação WordPress poderia ser facilmente falsificada. Eu tentei de novo, sem sucesso.</p>\n<p>Eu não pude ir para o WordCamp US 2015.</p>\n<p>Eu também não pude ir ao WordCamp US 2016, quando eles perguntaram se eu queria tentar novamente, e meu visto foi negado&#8230; de novo. Desta vez, acho que pelo menos o oficial pesquisou on-line por mim, viu que era verdade, mas não conseguiu fazer nada, pois minha situação não mudara.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão desapontada. Ainda fico triste de lembrar, devo confessar. Às vezes, existem barreiras e portões reais que uma simples mudança de mentalidade não pode abrir.</p>\n<h3>Caminhos cruzados</h3>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes, concentrei-me em minha empresa e no trabalho na comunidade. A saúde da minha mãe melhorou, ela está em ótima agora. Minha família apóia meu trabalho.</p>\n<p>Nós nos tornamos especialistas em WordPress na Haste. Desenvolvemos temas, plugins e sites para empresas no Brasil e na América. Agora tenho uma renda estável e vivo exclusivamente do meu trabalho com o WordPress. Estamos comemorando 10 anos em 2019.</p>\n<p>Eu viajei pelo Brasil por causa do WordPress, para falar em WordCamps e Meetups. Fui para Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre. Eu vejo mais e mais mulheres trabalhando com o WordPress, participando de meetups e WordCamps, e conversando, encontrando algo familiar no rosto das outras mulheres.</p>\n<p>No ano passado, decidimos que iríamos para o WordCamp Europa 2019 em Berlim, já que não precisamos de visto para a maioria dos países, incluindo a Alemanha.</p>\n<p>Desta vez, posso pagar (com muito planejamento e redução de despesas). Tenho que confessar que estou um pouco ansiosa com o processo de imigração.</p>\n<p>Meu objetivo no WordCamp Europa é conhecer o máximo de pessoas que posso. Não é uma questão de quantidade, mas se a comunidade do WordPress me ensinou algo foi que cada pessoa tem algo para ensinar e aprender. Então, se você estiver participando do WordCamp Europa, vamos nos conhecer!</p>\n<h3>Abrindo trilhas</h3>\n<p>Então agora eu espero que você possa ver o que essa viagem realmente significa para mim, e porque cada pequena conquista significa muito. Não é só porque foi difícil. Mas porque eu não sou a única que merece isso, mas infelizmente sou uma exceção entre outras pessoas que têm o mesmo histórico que eu.</p>\n<p>Há tantas meninas e meninos que não se atrevem a sonhar em visitar outros países ou até mesmo entrar na faculdade. E quando se atrevem, tem seus sonhos podados. Muitas crianças que não têm computador nem acesso à internet. A única diferença é que me foram dadas oportunidades, as pessoas acreditaram em mim. Portas foram abertas. E só então eu pude provar o meu valor.</p>\n<p>Agora meu próximo sonho é poder tornar a jornada um pouco mais fácil do que foi para mim, especialmente para mulheres e jovens brasileiros. Porque acho que é nossa responsabilidade na comunidade. Ensine outras pessoas, compartilhe informações, doe um pouco do seu tempo, crie novas ferramentas, plugins e recursos, oriente as pessoas. Como diz a tatuagem do meu irmão, seja a pessoa de que você precisava quando era mais jovem.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20the%20WordPress%20community%20helped%20me%20find%20my%20way&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fhow-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way%2F&title=How+the+WordPress+community+helped+me+find+my+way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-150x150.jpg&description=How the WordPress community helped me find my way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/\" title=\"How the WordPress community helped me find my way\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/\">How the WordPress community helped me find my way</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 12:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Anyssa Ferreira\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Henry Zhu Launches New Maintainers Anonymous Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/henry-zhu-launches-new-maintainers-anonymous-podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3117:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maintainers Anonymous</a> is a new podcast created by <a href=\"https://www.henryzoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Zhu</a>, who has been the primary maintainer of <a href=\"https://github.com/babel/babel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Babel</a> for the past two years. Babel is a JavaScript compiler used by Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, and millions of others.

Zhu recently left his job at Adobe to work on Babel and open source full-time. </p>\n<p>In his new podcast, Zhu is talking with other maintainers to unearth their valuable perspectives and share similar struggles. By presenting them as regular people, rather than faceless code projects, Zhu is aiming to encourage empathy for maintainers.</p>\n<p>Maintainers Anonymous is centered around the &#8220;how&#8221; of maintenance and Zhu is open to having guests from a variety of fields and disciplines, such as a librarian, gardener, or moderator. In an episode titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speedrunning with Omnigamer</a>,&#8221; Zhu and his first guest, Eric Koziel, discuss the intricacies of &#8220;speedrunning,&#8221; playing a video game with the goal of beating it as fast as possible. Koziel describes it as a medium for doing an optimization challenge. Since the games are just software, he and Zhu explored how speedrunning intersects with coding and talked about some of the parallels with maintaining open source software.</p>\n<p>The next two episodes are a series with guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sehurlburt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie Hurlburt</a>, a graphics engineer and owner of the company that makes <a href=\"http://www.binomial.info/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Basis</a>, an image/texture compression product.

It includes CSS tree shaking improvements that restore AMP compatibility for WordPress&#8217; default Twenty Nineteen theme, reducing the size of its stylesheet by 53%.</p>\n<p>In an effort to get more users opting for the Native mode option, the plugin&#8217;s development team has rebranded the template modes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this release the Paired mode has been rebranded as Transitional mode. One reason for this is that the classic mode was also a paired mode (where there are separate parallel URLs for the AMP version). But more importantly, the goal for this mode is to help facilitate a transition a site to being AMP-first, where there is no separate AMP-specific URLs. So the goal of the Transitional mode is to be a path to Native mode.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team has also decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/pull/2034\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rebrand Classic mode to “Reader” mode</a>, instead of deprecating it. It provides a basic AMP template for getting started that doesn&#8217;t necessarily match the site&#8217;s theme. Users can can add an “Exit Reader Mode” to the header of their sites with a setting in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 introduces compatibility with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA feature plugin</a>, bringing support for the service worker to AMP pages. It extends the service worker to cache AMP CDN assets, images, and Google Fonts. Since the PWA feature plugin is still under active development, the service worker integration is still considered experimental.</p>\n<p>Support for creating AMP Stories in WordPress is the next major feature coming to the plugin. A pre-release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/wiki/AMP-Stories-Experimental\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Stories editor</a> is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/releases/tag/1.2-alpha1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.2 alpha 1</a>, which also requires the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin.

In the past three years, Rich founded <a href=\"http://layup.media/\">a digital agency</a>, launched a popular PhotoShop <a href=\"https://purtypixels.com/\">resource site</a>, and started <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\">ThemeBeans</a>, a successful WordPress theme shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ThemeBeans and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\">CoBlocks</a>, Rich&#8217;s suite of page builder blocks in a plugin, have gone with him to Godaddy. (CoBlocks remains free, and now all the ThemeBeans products are too.)  Rich took some time to reflect with us on his path so far and where he sees the WordPress ecosystem going in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What led you to dive into the new post-Gutenberg reality of WordPress and create CoBlocks and Block Gallery? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been fascinated by the block editor ever since Matias’s Gutenberg demo during WordCamp US 2017. I was instantly convinced that Gutenberg would lead us into the next era of creation in WordPress. I saw an opportunity, was in a position to execute and had enough expertise to take it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did sales for these products meet your expectations?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually did not release paid versions for either CoBlocks or Block Gallery. There were plans to monetize both plugins, but at the time we were focused on delivering innovative solutions to Gutenberg and pushing the editor to its extremes. Adoption-wise, both plugins grew particularly fast, and are continuing to do so. In that sense, they most certainly exceeded my expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the near and long term future of the WordPress ecosystem? As solo developers and small firms are increasingly hired by bigger fish, especially hosting companies, will there still be a place for small entrepreneurs? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that the WordPress ecosystem will continue to be an innovative field for both entrepreneurs and larger companies. It’s all about innovation and being able to execute —  regardless of the size of the team behind the product or idea. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And over the last few years, the WordPress economy and its entrepreneurial leaders, have evolved into quite a mature ecosystem. I’d say the fact that companies such as GoDaddy are investing in the future of WordPress is a huge sign of that maturity and growth in our industry. Hosts, in particular, are uniquely equipped to make a huge difference in how so many folks use WordPress. Investing in products and talent that level-up the overall WordPress experience is good for us all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about GoDaddy made it seem like a good fit or you? Did you consider any other types of companies outside the hosting space?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I flew out to Phoenix to meet the WordPress leadership team at GoDaddy and it became quite clear that they were all-in on this new future of WordPress + Gutenberg.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy has assembled a passionate and highly qualified team of folks who are hyper-focused on improving the WordPress experience and leading the next wave of innovation in this space. Joining this team and leading the efforts as the Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience is a good and logical fit to fulfilling my personal mission to help make WordPress beautifully simpler. I knew that what we’d build would touch millions of sites and empower people all over the world to succeed online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Before GoDaddy came along, what was your plan in terms of growth and long-term sustainability?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having run a successful theme shop for a number of years, I understood the importance of having a solid plan for growth and sustainability. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My plan for both CoBlocks and Block Gallery was to release top-tiered paid versions of each, with innovative tools, blocks and design systems. Those would have likely arrived in Q3 of 2019, as our focus for the first half of the year was to innovate and grow our user base. Now I hope to continue on that same development trajectory, adding many of those same features to the current plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is your best advice for someone who is currently independent and wants to build a small business in the WordPress space today? What are the best lessons or advice you can provide?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, don’t let an opportunity get away from you. Learn to identify opportunities that you are perfectly suited to execute on, then dive right in. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for help and don’t be afraid to try something new. Learning how to learn and then taking that a step further by continuing to learn every single day, is a catalyst for enormous personal and professional growth. It’s not all about making cool stuff, it’s about challenging yourself to become the best version of yourself; the rest will fall into place. &nbsp;<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 21:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 Will Add 13 New Icons to the Dashicon Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88937\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2848:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dashicons</a>, the WordPress admin icon font, will be getting its first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> in three years when WordPress 5.2 ships.

I was working on a project for a woman&#8217;s rights organization that needed a &#8216;staff&#8217; post type. It was a little awkward explaining to them that there was a &#8216;businessman&#8217; icon we could use for free, or they could pay extra to have a custom &#8216;businesswoman&#8217; icon designed. Not a great look for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allen submitted a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/issues/285\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>, to see if someone would be willing to create a &#8220;businesswoman&#8221; and &#8220;businessperson&#8221; icon, but nobody had the time. Dashicons is maintained by a volunteer team and it can take a long time to get new icons designed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;About 5-6 months later I learned how to use Illustrator to create vector icons and submitted the icons myself,&#8221; Allen said.

Store owners with sites running on WordPress 5.0+ will now have access to eight new product blocks, including hand picked products, featured products, products by category/attribute, sale products, new products, top rated, products, and best selling products.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woocommerce-blocks.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These blocks were previously available as a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feature plugin</a> but have now been rolled into WooCommerce core. The plugin now requires WooCommerce 3.6 and will continue to be used for iterating and exploring future WooCommerce block editor features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/performance-improvements-in-3-6/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Performance improvements</a> were one of the major focuses for this version, which introduces product data lookup tables. WooCommerce core developers&#8217; long term plan is to move post meta to custom tables and a <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-product-tables-feature-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feature plugin</a> is currently in development towards this goal. In the meantime, lookup tables provide a structured index for product data that speeds up querying. This version also brings improvements to transient invalidation, changes to REST API initialization, caching improvements, and more.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Timmy Crawford highlighted a few frontend performance improvements in the 3.6 release post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 62% improvement in the load time when ordering and filtering products</li>\n<li>Reduced overall load time by bypassing inactive webhooks</li>\n<li>Reduced the load time for pages with category or product attribute lists</li>\n<li>Reduced load time of product pages with attributes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also includes the controversial new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-6-rc2-removes-marketplace-suggestions-from-product-listing-adds-setting-to-turn-them-off\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">marketplace suggestions</a> that advertise official extensions inside the WooCommerce admin. The setting for turning them off can be found under the &#8220;Accounts &#038; Privacy&#8221; section of the admin.</p>\n<p>For the full list of additional enhancements in 3.6, check out the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2019/04/17/woocommerce-3-6-has-arrived/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">release post</a> or view the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/readme.txt#L161\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a>.

It was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/14898\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renamed</a> to avoid confusion with the HTML5 section element and prevent potential overlap with future site/theme type sections, such as headers, sidebars, and footers. The first iteration of the Group block supports the ability to nest other blocks inside it and the ability to align the block and any of its child blocks that include alignment settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-17-at-12.41.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a minimal version at the moment and improvements about the flows to add inner blocks, group/ungroup blocks are expected in follow-up releases,&#8221; Gutenberg phase 2 technical lead Riad Benguella said. In testing the feature I found that it is indeed a rocky start and far from intuitive to use but a more refined grouping experience will be developed after further testing and feedback.</p>\n<p>The Group block lays the foundation for a future where WordPress themes may evolve to become block templates. In response to a comment about how the Group block could essentially replace the widget management interface, Benguella offered a glimpse of how Gutenberg will eventually transform the theme industry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a world where themes are made of block templates instead of php templates, there’s no need for widget areas.</p>\n<p>That said, Gutenberg is a huge change for WordPress and its community. With the new blocks concept, Phase 2 is about helping the WordPress community adopt this new concept without completely changing what a theme means in WordPress. We shouldn’t just abandon existing themes and switch into full-site editing without an iterative plan.</p>\n<p>We’ll eventually get there where everything is made of block templates and blocks but we need to make smaller steps first and the first one is the ability to use blocks instead of widgets in existing themes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.5 also adds the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14445\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">image fill option</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vertical alignment</a> support to the Media and Text blocks. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/media-text-vertical-align-small-1.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also includes a few minor but useful improvements, such as automatically populating the link field when the selected text is an email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-linked.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team is also making progress on the new widgets screen with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14612\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">barebones testing version</a> in place that will allow them to start investigating and tackling technical issues related to this screen. It&#8217;s not functional yet but provides a place to further explore the block editor in this context.</p>\n<p>The bug fixes included in Gutenberg 5.5 will be in the upcoming WordPress 5.2 release, which was previously targeted for April 30.

Till now I was living my life with my own surroundings, now it will be no more that much of hidden.</p>\n<p>I am a very simple person from Kolkata, India. I started my career with IBM ACE i.e an IBM education wing, as a Technical Teacher. I used to teach my students several subjects like C,C++, Perl and PHP. Although I was teaching many subjects my focus was in PHP starting from 2003. In the early days of 2009 I came to know about WordPress. From the first few days I was struggling with the Administrative panel and other services.</p>\n<p>In 2009 end I decided to step down from my job and started differently. I started development work and also continue teaching the students.</p>\n<p>I was decided to develop the websites and web applications with the WordPress only, and I got the version called `Carmen` 2.9 which was a relief for me to handle the CMS. I got some help from my students and friends who were engaged in WordPress development at that time. They teach me how I can handle the WordPress more proficient way. I learnt how to develop WordPress themes, started developing the plugins.</p>\n<h3>Working with WordPress</h3>\n<p>I started developing the website using WordPress from 2010 onwards. Later on 2014 I started developing WordPress theme for the Themeforest Market place. I also started developing the plugins which helps my development process to run smoothly.</p>\n<h3>How it changed My life</h3>\n<p>My life started changing from 2010 when I started developing with WordPress. The instability of my life was changed into a stable life, which was beyond my expectation. I was living a good life with my family. What else I can expect from WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What’s Different</h3>\n<p>Apart from developing the Websites and other application, I started my research on how the development process can be more smoother and flexible. I started working on WP CLI to developing the automated process for WordPress. I developed a script that helps developers to install the WordPress flawlessly using WP CLI. My linux knowledge also helped me to write shell scripts. The script can be found in my account at github. I am also trying to get into the easy deployment process with CI/CD for the developers using Bitbucket Pipeline and AWS.</p>\n<p>I slowly become an expert on the theme approval guidelines of Themeforest Market place. Apart from that I started writing blogs on the various topics related to WordPress. Achieved almost 3K reputation in StackOverflow. Developed Plugins in wordpress.org.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Even though I was developed many plugins and theme I never thought of uploading that in wordpress.org. I start realizing that to help many more people in WordPress, wordpress.org will be a better place than StackOverflow.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Kolkata</h3>\n<p>I joined Kolkata WordPress Community who was planning the WordCamp Kolkata, and thankfully they have selected me as a volunteer. Mr Subrata Sarkar( WordPress Core Contributor ) and the team who recognized me and give a huge responsibilities in WordCamp Kolkata 2019. It was again a tremendous experiences with WordPress. Since that was my first WordCamp I tried to fulfill my responsibilities. Become a Volunteer I learnt to be more polite and more decent to the people, make many more friends from different regions and countries.</p>\n<h3>My Inspirations</h3>\n<p>There are many people who inspired and helped me during my journey, its small tribute to them by mentioning a few : Abhik Goswami, Sneh Sagar Prajapati, Prabhas Chowdhury, Debobrata Debnath, Prosenjit Manna, Sk. Shamim Ullah, Soumit Pal, Subrata Sarkar.</p>\n<h3>My Words</h3>\n<p>Be polite to others. Be friendly to your Juniors and fellow developers. Try to teach them rather pointing to the mistakes. Attend Meetups. Contribute to the Community. Think what new you have done, and what new can be.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, stay fit with WordPress <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"bangla\">WordPress এবং স্থিতিশীলতা, বাংলা তে পড়ুন</h2>\n<p>WordPress র সাথে পরিচয় ২০০৯ এর December এ, শুরু থেকেই ভালো লাগা.

The company is protesting the moderators&#8217; actions by publishing zero-day vulnerabilities (those for which no patch has been issued) and then attempting to contact the plugin author via the WordPress.org support forums:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">continued</a> <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inappropriate</a> <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">behavior</a> we are <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up</a>, so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon).</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the linked incidents cited above, Grillot claims that moderators have deleted his comments, covered up security issues instead of trying to fix them, and promoted certain security companies for fixing hacked sites, among other complaints. </p>\n<p>In response, Plugin Vulnerabilities has published a string of vulnerabilities with full disclosure since <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initiating the protest</a> in September 2018. These posts detail the exact location of the vulnerabilities in the code, along with a proof of concept. The posts are followed up with an attempt to notify the developer through the WordPress.org support forum.</p>\n<p>Grillot said he hopes to return to Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; previous policy of responsible disclosure but will not end the protest until WordPress.org support forum moderators comply with the list of what he <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> as &#8220;appropriate behavior.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; security leadership is currently going through a transitional period after Aaron Campbell, head of WordPress Ecosystem at GoDaddy, stepped down from his position as head of security in December 2018. Automattic Technical Account Engineer Jake Spurlock is coordinating releases while the next person to wrangle the team is selected. This announcement was made in the #security channel, but Josepha Haden said there are plans for a more public post soon. Campbell did wish to publish the details of why he stepped down but said that he thinks it is important to rotate that role and that &#8220;the added influx of fresh energy in that position is really healthy.&#8221; </p>\n<p>When asked about the Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; protest against WordPress.org, Spurlock referenced the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Responsible Disclosure guidelines</a> on WordPress&#8217; Hackerone profile. It includes the following recommendation regarding publishing vulnerabilities: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Give us a reasonable time to correct the issue before making any information public. We care deeply about security, but as an open-source project, our team is mostly comprised of volunteers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Spurlock said that since those guidelines are more pertinent to core, dealing with third-party plugins is a trickier scenario. Ideally, the plugin author would be notified first, so they can work with the plugins team to push updates and remove old versions that may contain those vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress open-source project is always looking for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities,&#8221; Spurlock said. &#8220;We have a process for disclosing for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> and for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">core</a>. Neither of theses processes include posting 0-day exploits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Grillot did not respond to our request for comment, but the company&#8217;s recent blog posts contend that following responsible disclosure in the past would sometimes lead to vulnerabilities being &#8220;covered up,&#8221; and even at times <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cause them to go unfixed</a>.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org support forum moderators do not permit people to report vulnerabilities on the support forums or to engage in discussion regarding vulnerabilities that remain unfixed. The preferred avenue for reporting is to email plugins@wordpress.org so the plugins team can work with authors to patch plugins in a timely way.</p>\n<p>However, in the wild west world of plugins, which includes more than 55,000 hosted on WordPress.org, there are times when responsible disclosure falls apart and occasionally fails users. Responsible disclosure is not a perfect policy, but overall it tends to work better than the alternative. The Plugin Vulnerabilities service even states that they intend to return to responsible disclosure after the protest, essentially recognizing that this policy is the best way to coexist with others in the plugin ecosystem. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, publishing zero-day vulnerabilities exposes sites to potential attacks if the plugin author is not immediately available to write a patch. The only thing WordPress.org can do is remove the plugin temporarily until a fix can be released. This measure protects new users from downloading vulnerable software but does nothing for users who already have the plugin active. If site owners are going to protect themselves by disabling it until there is a fix, they need to know that the plugin is vulnerable. </p>\n<p>Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; controversial protest, which some might even call unethical, may not be the most inspired catalyst for improving WordPress.org&#8217;s approach to security. It is a symptom of a larger issue. WordPress needs strong, visible security leadership and a team with dedicated resources for improving the plugin ecosystem. Plugin authors need a better notification system for advising users of important security updates inside the WordPress admin. Most users are not subscribed to industry blogs and security services &#8211; they depend on WordPress to let them know when an update is important. Refining the infrastructure available to plugin developers and creating a more streamlined security flow is critical for repairing the plugin ecosystem&#8217;s reputation. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 03:37:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: WordCamp for Publishers is Coming to Columbus, OH, August 7-9, Call for Speakers Now Open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88366\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-is-coming-to-columbus-oh-august-7-9-call-for-speakers-now-open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2696:\"<p>The third edition of WordCamp for Publishers will be held in Columbus, OH, August 7-9, 2019, at the <a href=\"https://vuecolumbus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vue Columbus</a>.

The app helps users challenge their &#8220;automatic thoughts,&#8221; a term that refers to thoughts that come to a person spontaneously in response to a trigger, which can often be negative.</p>\n<p>Quirk lets users record a quick thought and will automatically narrow down a list of potential ways these thoughts are distorted. The distortions were inspired by the ones popularized in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UW5X4C/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy</a>. The user is then invited to challenge those distortions and write an alternative thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cZMMRywMDBL\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/5f9Qce5NQW.gif?resize=627%2C667&ssl=1\" alt=\"Quirk demo\" width=\"627\" height=\"667\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Conrad</a>, a software engineer at Segment, created Quirk as a non-commercial, personal project to make it easy for people to take control of their irrational thoughts using a common CBT technique. Quirk is not a substitute for a trained therapist but rather a tool for people to use on their own. Left unchecked, negative automatic thoughts can become emotional weights and lead to distorted thinking. Quirk is a simple app that helps people experience the world in a less negative way and develop more rational thinking patterns. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s super useful for day-to-day stuff,&#8221; Conrad said in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589700\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to comments on Hacker News. &#8220;Take a thought like &#8216;<em>I took too many hints in that interview question</em>.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That thought might lead to <em>&#8216;I must have failed that interview,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll fail all the rest of my interviews,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll never get another job,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I must be really bad at this, I should just give up.&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Each step seemed kind of logical at the time, but one thought led to the next and now you feel awful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CBT is a counter measure to this; it stops you at that first point and gives you a bunch of common logical fallacies that help you recognize why your thought is overreaching. You don’t know if you really flunked that interview, besides flunking one is good practice to pass the next one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad said these types of thought processes aren&#8217;t exactly a mental health issue but are common struggles for many people. Quirk can be a useful tool for anyone looking to recognize and remove their own cognitive biases.</p>\n<p>The iOS version of the app currently works better than the Android one, as the author said he doesn&#8217;t have an Android phone and finds it difficult to support the app on that platform. However, fixes are being pushed out regularly and many of the issues with crashing are getting resolved.</p>\n<h3>How the GPL Protects Users in Mental Health Tech</h3>\n<p>The code for Quirk can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and is open source under the GPL-3.0, which is not a popular choice for licensing mobile apps. I asked Conrad why he opted for the GPL license, as opposed to other popular open source licenses. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Mental Health tech is a really weird world,&#8221; Conrad said. &#8220;There’s a lot of folks who want to do the right thing, but end up doing really sketchy stuff. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, a lot of apps collect the thoughts you’re recording for ML (Machine Learning) or NLP (Natural Language Processing). The stated purpose of this is to help better identify suicide, depression, etc. Partially because of the subject matter, many apps aren’t clearly telling their users that this is happening.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So what ends up happening is a bunch of well intended researchers get access to your most sensitive thoughts. Which is fine, but they frequently aren’t aware of how valuable of a target they’re holding to a nefarious actor. Because it’s not like a database of passwords or credit card numbers, they tend to not think about security. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But thoughts are super valuable and dangerous for abusers and blackmailers; plus most people would rather give you their password in plaintext than show you their mental health thoughts. </p>\n<p>&#8220;So if I made Quirk MIT, I would worry that someone would take Quirk and launch their own version for research that tracks and stores user thoughts. Because the license doesn’t follow them, they could do it without telling a user and there would be little way for an average person to /know/ that this is happening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad has taken an inspiring, user-centric approach to licensing and privacy that ensures users of his app (and any derivatives) will have access to the code and a better understanding of where their data is being stored. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1114575448485191681\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, he outlined the privacy principles that underpin Quirk&#8217;s architecture:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Quirk, FOSS and privacy isn&#8217;t a focus, it&#8217;s a given. Outside the tech world, Quirk is not trying to be a FOSS CBT app, it&#8217;s trying to be a really good CBT app that happens to be FOSS. It&#8217;s not coming out and saying &#8220;hey we don&#8217;t store your deepest darkest secrets on some server somewhere.&#8221; User&#8217;s don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s a given. It doesn&#8217;t store things on the device because it&#8217;s trying to sell you on privacy, it does it because it&#8217;s the correct engineering decision. </p>\n<p>Regular people don&#8217;t look at the Golden Gate bridge and think about the structural quality of the bolts. They pull out their phones and take a picture. The responsibility of software is to make things frictionless and reduce the stuff someone has to think about before buying in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Conrad said he would like to see other developers build things using the app and conduct research, as long as they do so ethically. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a> has a detailed writeup of its design and engineering logic. It includes specific goals the code was built around in order to respect users&#8217; privacy and mental health, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Thoughts are more valuable than passwords, treat them that way.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Be extremely cautious about making engagement your core metric.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>But be clear and obvious within the app about what&#8217;s going on with the user&#8217;s data.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I really do want to see people use Quirk for research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just want it to follow more ethical practices of consent and data security. Someone should willingly give a researcher their thoughts and as little information should be given about the person as possible. When it’s stored, it should be stored safely and not on a publicly exposed DB for example. But for that to happen, it has to be open.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond GPL-specific licensing, making the app open source has many other benefits. Quirk has already been translated into six different languages. One of the byproducts of making a useful app open source is that it energizes contributors and speeds up the process of bringing the app to new audiences. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I cannot express how absolutely amazing it is that Quirk was translated into 6 languages in just a few days. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"🔥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2665.png\" alt=\"♥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"👏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan Conrad (@flaqueEau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1115843899594084352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feedback on the app so far has been mostly positive. One commenter on Hacker News <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589889\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thanked</a> Conrad for open sourcing the app because he wasn&#8217;t able to continue in-person CBT due to the cost:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been through CBT and stopped because of the cost. I feel that an app like this can complement those of us that have had face to face time but stopped for whatever reason.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Quirk is an inspiring example of how open source software can help people with every day problems. Its carefully-considered implementation respects users&#8217; sensitive information and doesn&#8217;t encourage an unhealthy attachment to the app. </p>\n<p>If you like Quirk and want to contribute, you can find the app on <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\">GitHub</a>, including directions for <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk/issues/42#issuecomment-480547963\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">translating it into different languages</a>.

Creator and maintainer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonbahl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Bahl</a> put the project up on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wp-graphql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> last week after people frequently asked how the community can support the project. WPGraphQL already has five backers, an $800 balance, and an estimated annual budget of $2,687.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Large well-known sites such as <a href=\"http://qz.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">qz.com</a> and <a href=\"http://theplayerstribune.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theplayerstribune.com</a> are in production with JavaScript front-ends that consume data from WordPress via WPGraphQL,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;PostLight Studio maintains a popular &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headless WP Starter</a>&#8221; project that initially started as a React + REST API boilerplate, but recently added WPGraphQL support as well.&#8221; </p>\n<p>One of the most important signs of the project&#8217;s growth are the extensions that developers are building on top of it, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ashhitch/wp-graphql-yoast-seo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Yoast SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pristas-peter/wp-graphql-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Gutenberg</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Quartz/wp-graphql-content-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Content Blocks</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields</a> is getting very close to an initial release and Caldera Forms is also <a href=\"https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues/3149\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exploring integrations with WPGraphQL</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The two most-searched things on <a href=\"http://WPGraphQL.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL.com</a> are &#8220;Advanced Custom Fields&#8221; and &#8220;WooCommerce,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;People are interested in using WPGraphQL with other popular WordPress projects, and WPGraphQL for WooCommerce is a reaction to the folks that are already looking for alternatives to the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WPGraphQL for WooCommerce Seeks $15K in Funding</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for WooCommerce</a> is an extension created by Geoffry Taylor that has started to gain some traction. Taylor is a core contributor to the main WPGraphQL plugin. He has just published <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kidunot89/wpgraphql-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Kickstarter to help fund development</a> of the extension and Bahl is consulting with him on implementation details and code reviews. </p>\n<p>Taylor began contributing to the WPGraphQL project last year after discovering the repository and finding that it lacked the features he needed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I was looking for a solution that would allow me to create React-Apollo JS apps that could be used as WordPress themes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the solution couldn&#8217;t rely on a node server, because a large portion of my clients use shared hosting. WPGraphQL was a perfect fit for what I needed, but it lacked the features I needed at the time. This led to me contributing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since then Taylor has also created other libraries and tools that work directly or indirectly with WPGraphQL, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-composer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Composer</a>, a React-Apollo component library, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/oil-based-boilerplate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oil-Based Boilerplate</a>, a boilerplate for developing React-powered WordPress themes, plugins, and guten-blocks that use shared components.</p>\n<p>Taylor is seeking $15K in funding for development of the WPGraphQL WooCommerce extension, which would enable him to apply 100% of his time to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The question I think a lot of people have, is what does this extension provide that WPGraphQL and WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t already?&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;It adds WooCommerce support to the WPGraphQL server. It is being designed to match and increase the functionality of WooCommerce REST to make it as easy as possible to convert your app from the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor said the extension is past the initial explorations and is well into development. If a developer follows the instructions in the README they will be able to query products and their variations, coupons, orders, refunds, customer information, and (after the next update), order items from the WPGraphQL endpoint. He said that with the exception of products, none of the data is queryable for any user without shop-manager level capabilities. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Customer-level functionality is the target goal right now, meaning customers can register/login, update the cart, and checkout,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested can follow the project&#8217;s progress on <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> or get involved on Slack at <a href=\"http://wp-graphql.slack.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wp-graphql.slack.com</a> in the #woocommerce channel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:49:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordSesh Returns May 22, 2019, Speaker Application Deadline is April 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-returns-may-22-2019-speaker-application-deadline-is-april-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1978:\"<p>The next edition of <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordSesh</a> is scheduled for Wednesday, May 22, 2019, from 10am-8pm EDT (UTC-4) &#8211; just a little over one month away.

Organizers expect applicants to submit original talks that do not already exist online. The process is somewhat competitive, as only 10 speakers will be selected for the event. Those with approved applications will receive two coaching and review sessions for their talks and a $250 stipend. WordSesh organizers plan to notify applicants of their status by Monday, April 29, and will announce the accepted speakers May 1. Applicants may submit two different presentation topics and are also encouraged to record a two-minute video pitch to sell their ideas.</p>\n<p>All WordSesh presentations will be recorded and available online after the live event.

Some even felt blindsided by the original implementation. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Last week, the release candidate was running on my staging server, and out of nowhere, I noticed these ads being inserted inline with the rest of the WC admin list tables,&#8221; Tobin Fekkes said. &#8220;What a shock that was! I thought I’d developed a bad case of malware or something. What nasty plugin was corrupting my core, default products table, order table, etc?! Oh, just core WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have never once gone looking to add a plugin to my site by starting at the &#8216;Products&#8217; tab. Because it doesn’t belong there. If I want to install an extension or plugin, I will go to the (aptly named) &#8216;Extensions&#8217; tab or “Plugins” tab.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is rather telling that we as longtime developers who attend every Dev chat, bookmark and check this Dev blog daily, and test all your betas and release candidates STILL had no idea about this blatant abuse of trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce, addressed the issue of marketplace suggestions seeming to come out of nowhere in a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-6-to-add-marketplace-suggestions-despite-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-from-developer-community#comment-285682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on our recent post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are committed to working with our community, including the plugin review team, and responding to feedback. Just as a reminder, the Marketplace Suggestions feature was developed in the open in a long-running feature branch/PR which was merged to master a month ago. It was mentioned in the Beta 1 Release notes, and was testable during Beta1 and prior on master.</p>\n<p>It is often only when the release candidate comes out that we get certain kinds of feedback. It’s an important stage in the development cycle when we want and expect input. With the 3.6 RC1 live, we received specific feedback that we could take into consideration and act on. Thanks to the developers, end users, and the plugin review team for all their help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.6 RC2 doesn&#8217;t make any changes to the frequency with which users will need to dismiss the ads. Some have commented that it is more like &#8220;snoozing&#8221; the ads, since they require dismissal every day for five days, only to return every month thereafter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We continue to be in contact with the plugin review team to ensure the suggestions are in accordance with the guidelines,&#8221; Wilkens said. &#8220;There is a live conversation on the definition of suggestion/advert dismissibility. We will participate in that conversation and honor the outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As this implementation of marketplace suggestions still is not satisfactory to many WooCommerce users and developers, a plugin for turning off has already been submitted and approved in the WordPress plugin directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/surbma-woocommerce-without-marketplace-suggestions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Without Marketplace Suggestions</a> removes the suggestions permanently without users having to continually dismiss them. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:18:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"HeroPress: Firefighter to Web Developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2735\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:130:\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=firefighter-to-web-developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13123:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041019-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I wouldn\'t be anything without the help of those around me.\" /><p>I’m jolted awake to the sound of the tones going off in my room. I knew that I hadn’t been asleep long because we’d already run a late call and it was still dark outside. Running to the truck, I hear the address come out over the radio for a medical call. It’s the third time this week we’ve been called to the same house.</p>\n<p>My driving is on autopilot because I know the city streets like the back of my hand. Not only had I worked in the same fire department for the last 6 years, but I’d also grown up in this city. On this and many other times I’d been woken up in the middle of the night, I’m starting to realize that I’m losing my passion for the job I once loved.</p>\n<h3>How I Got Into Firefighting</h3>\n<p>At 19 years old I was working in fast food, and I knew I needed to do something more with my life. I wasn’t really keen on going to college just yet, so I started looking for jobs that only needed vocational school. Knowing that I wouldn’t be a very good police officer, I signed up for fire school.</p>\n<p>During fire school I found the only way to get a job as a firefighter in Florida was to also be an EMT in order to run medical calls, so I enrolled in there as well. While I was in school, one of the instructors I met told me their department was taking on volunteers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Six years in the field, a year of paramedic school, and many sleepless nights later, I’m driving to a call feeling trapped in a career that I don’t care for anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the perks of being a firefighter is that in between calls the free time is ours to do what we like, we just need to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice. Some of the time we watch movies and play video games, but I wanted that time to do something productive that I could turn into an opportunity for a side gig.</p>\n<h3>Why I Chose Web Developer</h3>\n<p>I stumbled across a YouTube video that demonstrated how to create a webpage with HTML. I loaded a page that stereotypically read “Hello World” and I was hooked. I didn’t even own a computer at this time in my life, but my wife had a MacBook Air. She was nice enough to let me borrow it so I could keep learning. Downloading a text editor, I started creating web pages and loading them up in a browser. Though, as I was creating these pages, it was pretty obvious there weren&#8217;t any live websites out there that looked as bad as what I was creating.</p>\n<p>While going through YouTube looking for more tutorials, I kept seeing videos for this thing called WordPress in the sidebar. Curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on one of the videos. I saw how pages were being created from an admin background and how themes changed the look of sites, while plugins added functionality. I was completely blown away.</p>\n<p>By this time, I had purchased a $250 Chromebook I was running Linux from, and I decided that I was going to run a local development environment on this little computer with a 16GB hard drive. I managed to succeed, and with each accomplishment I had, I found that I was becoming extremely passionate about building these little websites.</p>\n<h3>Meeting Other Humans</h3>\n<p>I knew that I wasn’t going to make it very far past the beginning stages without help from someone other than a search engine. Though without any knowledge of the community and how they would act towards me, going to a local meetup was something that made me very uncomfortable. I thought the second they caught a glimpse of my Chromebook and my silly beginner questions they’d have me out the door before I could sit down.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even in the parking lot before my first meetup, I was sitting in my car telling myself that I should just drive home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I walked into the meetup I was surprised to find people in all stages of their growth with WordPress. There were even people that knew less than me, and they were accepted just as much as I was. It was there I learned about this event called a WordCamp. I knew that whatever it was, I needed to be there and it was only two months away.</p>\n<h3>First WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Sitting in my car in front of my first WordCamp Orlando, I felt the same feelings that I did before my first meetup. I reminded myself how welcoming the meetup was, and that this wasn’t going to be any different. When I grabbed my seat in the main auditorium, I started feeling pretty strongly that I was alone in a room of 300 people. There were business owners that could actually make money off WordPress, and it felt that there weren’t many people at my experience level. As I went from talk to talk, the topics flew over my head and I became very overwhelmed. I told myself that I was going to stick it out till lunch and that I could go home after if I wanted.</p>\n<p>Lunch came and as I was walking around looking for a good place to sit, I noticed a familiar face sitting at a table with no one next to him. Up until now, I had been learning exclusively at Lynda.com and Treehouse. I was learning to use the Genesis Framework and took a couple courses by an instructor named <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/freed-from-the-soil-lab/\">Jesse Petersen</a>, and this guy looked just like him. Walking up next to him I said: “I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but you look just like an instructor I learned from on Treehouse.” He laughed and said that he was indeed that instructor from Treehouse.</p>\n<p>The pitch of my voice shot up an octave, and I started fanning out over how I had learned so much from him and asked if I could eat with him. While we ate, I told him that I was a firefighter and how I also wanted to become a web developer and build websites. By the end of the lunch, he told me that he saw something in me and that he wanted to mentor me if I was ok with that. Was I ok with that?!? Of course, I was ok with that! I was doing my best to sound cool all the while I’m absolutely ecstatic on the inside.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day I followed him around to talks, and while I was listening, he was setting up my computer with tools to help get me set up for further development. He added me to his Slack channel and told me that we were going to be working together remotely. When the day finished he asked me where we were having dinner in between the last session and the after-party.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve never gone from feeling so out of place somewhere to then feeling so welcomed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was talking to a person that had absolutely no gain from helping me out, yet spent the entirety of his day getting me set up to work with him in the future.</p>\n<p>Jesse wasn’t feeling well the next day due to an illness he had called Cystic Fibrosis. He said that he would keep up with me through the day on Slack though. Whenever I felt like I didn’t belong I would look at the tools Jesse had installed on my computer and the Slack channel and would remember that I was welcome. I was going to be learning some awesome stuff, and now I had a mentor.</p>\n<h3>Gettin&#8217; Paid</h3>\n<p>I spent the next few months going to two other WordCamps learning as much as I could and meeting as many people as possible. After going down to WordCamp Miami, I got approached by a local agency owner at a meetup that had some extra work I could help out with. Little did I know, they were also friends with Jesse and he had told them about me and what I’d been learning. This gave me a chance to get my feet wet and build some very strong friendships with some amazing people. I was now making money doing what I loved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four months later I got a Slack message from one of my friends telling me that Jesse had passed away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was on shift at the fire department that day, and I felt like someone had hit me with a bat. He was due to get new lungs any time, and just the day before was telling me how he was going to start a new life once he had the strength of new lungs to do so. We were all crushed to hear of his passing. I knew it was going to be hard moving forward without him, but I knew that’s what he would have wanted.</p>\n<h3>Keynote Presentation</h3>\n<p>I continued working on my skills until I was asked to do a keynote presentation at WordCamp Orlando. The very WordCamp I’d thought about leaving halfway through just a year before. The owner of the agency I was working for, Chris Edwards, told me they’d had a speaker back out and they needed someone to fill in, so they asked <i>me</i>. They wanted me to tell my story of how I had gotten into the WordPress community. I agreed, believing it was only going to a small room full of people, but when I said yes, I was then told I would be giving the opening keynote address in front of the entire WordCamp. I had already said yes, so now there was no way that I could back down and tell him no.</p>\n<p>As I was standing on stage waiting to be introduced, I was relieved to find there was a podium. Now no one could see my legs shaking as I stood there for an hour. I could now put all my focus on making sure the hand holding the microphone stayed steady. My talk was on the past year that had led me to this point and all of the fears and vulnerabilities I’d faced. If there was someone that was feeling the way I had a year ago, I wanted them to know that they were welcome and I was excited to have them there.</p>\n<h3>Leaving the Fire Service</h3>\n<p>The rest of the weekend passed, and I got a message from my friend Chris Edwards telling me that a company that makes a donation plugin called Give was looking for a support technician. Matt Cromwell, who was about to be my new boss, was sitting in the audience while I gave my keynote presentation. I filled out the application and got a response back that he wanted to set up an interview.</p>\n<p>A year has passed since that time, and I’ve grown so much in my knowledge of web development, website management, and WordPress. I’ve just started my first business as a freelance WordPress developer, and again I’m feeling the same fears, excitement, and vulnerabilities I felt every time I started to push myself.

I know that I’m in the right place now, because every day I wake up I’m happy that I get to work with WordPress and interact with this awesome community.

Founder Rich Tabor is joining GoDaddy as Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience and will lead a team dedicated to understanding users&#8217; needs and expanding the company&#8217;s Gutenberg-related products. Tabor&#8217;s fellow CoBlocks founders Jeffrey Carandang and Alex Denning will not be joining GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>All the commercial themes in the ThemeBeans catalog are now available for free on <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. Current customers will continue to receive theme support and remote updates until April 8, 2020. </p>\n<p>According to Aaron Campbell, GoDaddy&#8217;s head of WordPress Ecosystem &#038; Community, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> will continue to be freely available on WordPress.org. It currently has more than 3,000 active installations and averages a 4.7-star rating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing will change with the plugin except that it will be added to the GoDaddy account on .org,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible it might be renamed or rebranded in the future, but that&#8217;s unknown either way at this point. And yes, it will still be on the WordPress.org directory for everyone not just GoDaddy customers (and we plan to add more to it as we develop new blocks).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell could not yet share a roadmap for the plugin as Tabor just started and will be heavily involved in determining the plugin&#8217;s future at GoDaddy. Tabor will also be leading a development team that is bringing on more React talent to assist with Gutenberg tasks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hiring React devs that are capable with Gutenberg is a newer thing that we&#8217;re really not totally sure whether it&#8217;ll be difficult or not or even how it&#8217;ll look,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;Do you hire WordPress people? React people? Only those that do both? Do you hire both and pair them up to learn from each other? It&#8217;s a thing we&#8217;re learning in this new post-Gutenberg world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he was surprised that his products had attracted GoDaddy&#8217;s interest but also found it to be validating of his own efforts and the potential of the block editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Throughout my time building themes, and then blocks, I’ve learned the real value of getting eyes on a project: Not only do you get the community rallying behind your ideas, such as the Block Manager recently added in Gutenberg 5.3, but you receive a TON of feedback and inspiration,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;Building on that feedback, consistently delivering clever ideas, and executing on the marketing front with inspiring videos, has landed us in a very opportune position.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy has acquired a handful of WordPress companies and services during the past few years (ManageWP, Sucuri, WP Curve), but Tabor&#8217;s products are the first Gutenberg-related acquisition for the company. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it means that the WordPress ecosystem is important, that it’s maturing, and probably most of all &#8211; that it’s moving and changing,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I think all of those are good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has changed a lot in WordPress. It’s not just a new editor or new interface, it’s a whole new system that brings with it a whole new group of challenges. Companies like GoDaddy recognizing this and supporting innovation is a healthy sign of growth and maturity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s resources will enable CoBlocks, ThemeBeans, and Block Gallery to move faster and add features that were previously out of reach for Tabor&#8217;s small team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ll go from just two developers, to a team of incredibly bright engineers,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I won’t be spending time figuring out all the intricacies of monetizing a premium plugin in today’s ever-changing WordPress ecosystem. Instead, I can focus on leading the team’s efforts on bringing a better page building experience to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He will also have access to insights and data that will enable his team to make more informed decisions about the tools and blocks they build.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This view into how entrepreneurs and business owners are using WordPress is something I could never have achieved at a meaningful scale, and I know it will help me move more confidently in the future landscape of Gutenberg,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 04:15:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6874\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3882:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

This is one of the goals on the roadmap Matt Mullenweg outlined in his <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9 Projects for 2019</a> post.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-07-at-9.55.15-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Based on the requirements outlined in the beginning of the document, it looks like the Gutenberg team is working to make the transition from widgets to blocks as seamless as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing blocks in wp-admin/widgets.php and the wp-admin/customize.php should use the same block editor that wp-admin/post-new.php uses.</li>\n<li>The block editor should read and update blocks in widget-editing areas via the REST API.</li>\n<li>Upgrading WordPress must not affect the appearance of the user&#8217;s site, or any of their existing widgets.</li>\n<li>Existing Core and third-party widgets must remain functional in the new block-based interface.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility must be maintained. That is, themes and plugins that use public widget APIs must remain functional.</li>\n<li>During a transition period, it should be possible to disable the block-based interface and return to the classic widget-editing interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The requirements for backwards compatibility are a tall order but will make it much easier for users to trust WordPress during this transition. Content will not be forced into the new interface and users will retain the option to use the classic widget-editing screen if they prefer. The team has not yet announced a date for when widgets will be officially deprecated. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-3rd-april/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg version 5.4</a> was released last week with vertical alignment support for the columns block, a playsInline option in the video block, and a number of other minor enhancements.

When users search for a plugin that matches a term for an existing Jetpack feature, the plugin now inserts an artificial, dismissible search result into the first plugin card slot, identifying the corresponding Jetpack feature. </p>\n<p>The Jetpack team said users have a hard time knowing what features are available, with 45 modules packaged into the plugin. The idea behind the proof of concept for the suggestions was to improve the discoverability of Jetpack&#8217;s existing features. Many in the developer community became outraged after it was discovered that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack was also advertising paid upgrades</a> in this space as well. </p>\n<p>The fact that it was rolled out with promotions for paid upgrades made it seem to many onlookers that the discoverability problem was just a pretext for injecting advertising. The WordPress Plugin Team also said it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may or may not be a violation of the plugin directory guidelines</a> but that the team was still &#8220;arguing about the semantics internally.&#8221;  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/04/04/jetpack-7-2-1-maintenance-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 7.2.1</a> was released today, removing all feature suggestions that previously advertised upgrades.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made a mistake, and we’re moving to correct it immediately,&#8221; Jetpack team representative Jesse Friedman said.  &#8220;Our intention with these feature hints is to help you discover helpful features of Jetpack that you already have, right when you need them most. Today we’re correcting an error in judgement that resulted in the hints suggesting Jetpack features that actually required an upgrade.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Characterizing the mistake as &#8220;an error in judgment&#8221; is an admission that rolling out feature suggestions with paid upgrades was a conscious decision. One month later, the Jetpack team decided it was a poor choice. This appears to have be driven by the community&#8217;s reaction, but Jetpack did not elaborate on how or why they reached the decision to revert the promotions for paid upgrades.</p>\n<h3>Jetpack 7.2.1 Updates Design for &#8220;Hints,&#8221; Plans to Adopt WordPress Core Solution in the Future</h3>\n<p>The 7.2.1 maintenance release also changes the design for the feature suggestions, which they are now referring to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/feature-hints/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feature Hints</a>.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re reducing confusion around feature hints by simplifying the design and changing some text; this way it’s clear that feature hints are from Jetpack and are easily dismissible,&#8221; Friedman said.</p>\n<p>After updating to the latest release, you can see the revised design on the plugin search screen with new text: &#8220;This suggestion was made by Jetpack, the security and performance plugin already installed on your site.&#8221; Jetpack will disable the hints once administrators have dismissed three hints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.30.07-AM-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Going forward we want to help create a feature hints solution that works for all WordPress users and plugin developers,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;We are excited to work with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggestions like this one</a>, by Joost de Valk, and see how we might be able to find a solution in WordPress core to help users discover plugin features, and prevent this very common issue.

They are dismissible, but the frequency with which they will be shown is one of the most contentious aspects of WooCommerce&#8217;s proposed implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’ll only show 1 on the Products screen, and 5 on the Product – empty state, Orders – empty state or Edit Product metabox.</li>\n<li>Each suggestion is dismissible, we are not providing an option to dismiss all suggestions (other than if you choose to hide them).</li>\n<li>We’re only showing 1 suggestion at a time, if a customer dismisses this, they won’t see another one for 24-hours.</li>\n<li>If suggestions are dismissed more than five times. No further suggestions are shown in that location ( i.e. Products Listing ) for a month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WooCommerce is providing a filter to turn off the suggestions, and this will likely soon be available as a plugin from the community.

In a comment on an issue titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/23198\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rethinking 3.6&#8217;s Dashboard Ads</a>,&#8221; Josh Kohlbach contends that WooCommerce should limit its marketing to the plugin&#8217;s dedicated Extensions screen in the dashboard: </p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition, didn&#8217;t anyone think it might be a conflict of interest for WooCommerce the commercial entity to use WooCommerce the open source plugin to show ads in this manner? Bit anti-competitive to all the 3rd party devs out there (of which there are a lot).</p>\n<p>WooCommerce already has an amazing page under WooCommerce->Extensions with full searching capabilities etc. Why would you want to show irrelevant ads during a user&#8217;s everyday workflow?! Store owners use these screen daily, it&#8217;s terrible UX.</p>\n<p>I suggest that it gets ripped out in its entirety and filed under &#8220;cool implementation/fun to code but horrible idea for actual users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those who do not stand to benefit from profits from the 400+ extensions on the WooCommerce.com marketplace, the intrusions in the product admins screen seem all the more offensive. Marketplace suggestions have not been well-received by third-party extension developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is in direct competition to every third-party developer that is not selling on WooCommerce’s marketplace,&#8221; Jamie Madden, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.wcvendors.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WC Vendors Marketplace</a>, said. &#8220;I am one of these. This is advertising for your commercial products, no matter how you try and wrap this. You have an extensions page already which is more than enough, but advertising your products every 24 hours is going too far. This is completely unacceptable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The general consensus of those participating in the ticket is that injecting ads into product management screens will create a disruption to store managers&#8217; workflow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I too am very concerned about this,&#8221; digital agency owner <a href=\"https://www.bernskioldmedia.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Erik Bernskiold</a> said. &#8220;I get that WooCommerce want to benefit from their commercial side, too, and there are many ways to do this. But in this case, it feels like this is at a great disregard for the users. Hijacking a product list, order list or a user interface element in this way is a major interruption of the user experience. It&#8217;s not the place for an ad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion have suggested that WooCommerce make it an opt-in toggle in the settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only one scenario where I think this feature should stay in place and could be beneficial: If this feature is controlled by an opt-in toggle in WC settings,&#8221; <a href=\"http://jeremypry.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Pry</a> said. &#8220;Otherwise, this whole feature should be removed entirely. Store owners don&#8217;t need advertisements in their admin dashboard. In my opinion, leaving this feature in place would be very harmful to the WooCommerce community.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Marketplace Suggestions Require Dismissal Every Day for 5 Days, Only to Return 1 Month Later</h3>\n<p>The fact that the suggestions cannot actually be dismissed for good is one issue that developers predict will end up aggravating WooCommerce users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dismissing just to keep hounding the user, that&#8217;s not dismissing&#8230; that is snoozing,&#8221; WordPress developer <a href=\"https://mindsize.me/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Garman</a> said. &#8220;Because I told you 5 times that I don&#8217;t want to see your ads, that doesn&#8217;t mean come back in a month. The average user shouldn&#8217;t have to use a filter to make ads go away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up dialing back the frequency of the ads after they are closed, given that nearly all those participating in the conversation consider it unacceptable to require dismissal five days in a row, with the same process repeated every month thereafter. The frequency with which they are displayed is unusually aggressive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t think it technically violates the guidelines it’s just obnoxious and makes WooCommerce look like a low rent solution,&#8221; Astoundify founder <a href=\"http://www.astoundify.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Pickering</a> said. &#8220;It seems we are in a midst of a monetization push and they are looking for any where they can add up sells. Apparently doing so gracefully has gone out the window.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the overwhelmingly negative feedback, WooCommerce appears to be ploughing forward on its plan to ramp up its marketing in the admin. Automattic is a business and it needs to make money with WooCommerce. Most participants in the discussion do not seem opposed to WooCommerce making money with marketplace suggestions but are strongly requesting that they do not inject ads in places where users are working on their own products in the admin. </p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with ya&#8217;ll trying to squeeze out some more money from users &#8211; so long as it&#8217;s done tastefully, and in a way that actually provides value to the user, instead of spamming and hindering them,&#8221; @justlevine <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/23198#issuecomment-479616682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the GitHub issue. </p>\n<p>Based on the WooCommerce developer community&#8217;s feedback, many are in agreement that they will only support changes will be respectful to store owners working in the admin. They would prefer WooCommerce focused its efforts on improving the existing Extensions tab, instead of injecting items from the marketplace on other screens. The current implementation of marketplace suggestions needs work, because it is too heavy-handed in displaying ads after users indicate through the UI that they want to dismiss them. </p>\n<p>Most participants in the discussion are in favor of letting store owners decide if they want to see ads for extensions on their product admin screens. They would prefer that users opt in through a more transparent way than simply agreeing to terms of service. At the very least, most prefer WooCommerce add a setting that would allow store owners to easily turn marketplace suggestions off. If Automattic wants this new feature to be successful, the company needs to revise the implementation to be something that doesn&#8217;t instantly make the majority of the WooCommerce developer community want to turn it off. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 22:55:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 350 – Don’t Touch My Plugin Search Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88558&preview=true&preview_id=88558\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-350-dont-touch-my-plugin-search-results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1895:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss a controversial feature in Jetpack 7.1 that adds feature suggestions to plugin search results.

I spoke a bit about this kind of thing at WordCamp US last year, but if you don&#8217;t feel like sitting through a half hour video, let me summarise my thoughts. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree that React is hard. I <em>strongly</em> disagree with the commonly contrasted view that HTML, CSS, PHP, or vanilla JavaScript are easy. They&#8217;re all just as hard to work with as React, sometimes more-so, particularly when having to deal with the exciting world of cross-browser compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage that PHP has over modern JavaScript development isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s easy, or that the tooling is better, or more reliable, or anything like that. The advantage is that it&#8217;s familiar. If you&#8217;re new to web development, React is just as easy anything else to start with.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Something I’m seeing a lot.<br /><br />Beginners: This makes sense, we understand it.<br /><br />Experienced developers: There’s no way beginners would understand it.

It&#8217;s such an incomprehensible, thankless, unreliable process, the tenacity of anyone who makes it out the other side should be applauded. That said, this high barrier is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working in this industry for long enough to have forgotten the number of iterations of my personal development environment I&#8217;ve gone through, to get to where I can set up something for myself which <em>isn&#8217;t awful</em>. React wasn&#8217;t around for all of that time, so that can&#8217;t be the reason web development has been hard for as long as I remember. What is, then?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Doing Better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been tinkering with a tool to help deal with the difficulties of contributing to WordPress. That tool is called <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/testpress/\">TestPress</a>, it&#8217;s getting pretty close to being usable, at least on MacOS. Windows support is a little less reliable, but getting better. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> If you enjoy tinkering with tools, too, you&#8217;re welcome to try out the development version, but it does still has some bugs in it. Feedback and PRs are always welcome! There are some screenshots in <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/testpress/issues/114\">this issue</a> that give an idea of what the experience is like, if you&#8217;d like to check it out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TestPress is not a panacea: at best, it&#8217;s an attempt at levelling the playing field a little bit. You shouldn&#8217;t need years of experience to build a reliable development environment, that should be the bare minimum we provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>React is part of the solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do to make web development something that anyone can easily get into. I think React is part of the solution to this, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React isn&#8217;t without its problems, of course. Modern JavaScript can encourage iteration for the sake of iteration. Certainly, there&#8217;s a drive to React-ify All The Things (a trap I&#8217;m guilty of falling into, as well). React&#8217;s development model is fundamentally different to that of vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, which is why it can seem incomprehensible if you&#8217;re already well versed in the old way of doing things: it requires a shift in your mental model of how JavaScript works. This is a hard problem to solve, but it&#8217;s not insurmountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a little controversially, I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think that React is guilty of causing the web to become less accessible. At worst, it&#8217;s continuing the long standing practice of web standards making accessibility an optional extra. Building anything beyond a basic, non-interactive web page with just HTML and CSS will inevitably cause accessibility issues, unless you happen to be familiar with the mystical combinations of accessible tags, or applying aria attributes, or styling your content in just the right way (and none of the wrong ways).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React (or any component-based development system, really) can improve accessibility for everyone, and we&#8217;re seeing this with Gutenberg already. By providing a set of base components for plugin and theme authors to use, we can ensure the correct HTML is produced for screen readers to work with. Much like desktop and mobile app developers don&#8217;t need to do anything to make their apps accessible (because it&#8217;s baked into the APIs they use to build their apps), web developers should have the same experience, regardless of the complexity of the app they&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguing that accessibility needs to be part of the design process is the wrong argument. Accessibility shouldn&#8217;t be a consideration, it should be unavoidable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do Better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, can we do better? Absolutely. There&#8217;s always room for improvement. People shouldn&#8217;t need to learn React if they don&#8217;t want to. They shouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the complexities of the WCAG. They should have the freedom to tinker, and the reassurance that they can tinker without breaking everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pre-React web didn&#8217;t arrive in its final form, all clean, shiny, and perfect. It took decades of evolution to get there. The post-React web needs some time to evolve, too, but it has the benefit of hindsight: we can compress the decades of evolving into a much shorter time period, provide a fresh start for those who want it, while also providing backwards compatibility with the existing ways of doing things.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 06:31:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Is Promoting Paid Upgrades on Plugin Search Screen, WordPress Plugin Team Says it “May be a Violation” of Directory Guidelines\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88485\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:152:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8991:\"<p>Yesterday the discussion surrounding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack&#8217;s implementation of feature suggestions in the plugin search screen</a> became heated after developers pointed out that Automattic is also using these suggestions to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results#comment-284507\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">promote paid upgrades</a>. You can test this by searching for &#8220;backups&#8221; where you find that Jetpack&#8217;s commercial offering takes the place of the first result, pushing all other results further down one slot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jetpack-advertising-paid-upgrades.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The feature suggestions were added in versions 7.1 to inform users of an existing feature in Jetpack when they search for something similar. The Jetpack team said they developed it to solve a discovery problem, where users are quite often not familiar with all of Jetpack&#8217;s 45 modules and end up installing plugins to perform functionality that Jetpack already includes. A PR in the Jetpack repository has been merged to <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/11876\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">only show feature suggestions when the user&#8217;s plan supports it</a>, so it looks like these promotions for commercial features will be removed in a future release of the plugin. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Automattic intentionally rolled out the feature suggestions in its current form (with paid upgrades included) to test the waters and gauge the community&#8217;s reaction, or if it is simply a mistake. The PR was marked as an enhancement, not a bug. </p>\n<p>According to Plugin Team member Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, feature suggestions with paid upgrades included is &#8220;likely a violation&#8221; of the plugin directory&#8217;s guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Promoting other plugins or premium upgrades in the same space would likely not be allowed, because it would be misleading or an incorrect place to put &#8216;advertising,&#8217; Wood said. &#8220;Guidelines already say not to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I contacted the Plugin Team today and it seems the topic of feature suggestions on the plugin screen are still a matter of ongoing debate. The team would not officially confirm whether or not Jetpack is currently in violation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t confirm that at this time,&#8221; Mika Epstein said. &#8220;It might be a violation, but it also may not be. Much of that comes down to intent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A case can be made that they&#8217;re promoting paid services for existing features, and is that different from an image-optimizer plugin promoting it&#8217;s own service which you&#8217;re already using? It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re promoting separate plugins, so it&#8217;s in a very odd grey area for services.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Epstein said the team is &#8220;still arguing the semantics internally about that one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many people have asked why Jetpack has not been removed from the plugin directory for advertising its commercial offerings on the plugin screen. The Plugin Team&#8217;s official response is that if Jetpack is in violation, they reserve the right to make an exception and opt not to close it. Epstein, on behalf of the team, offered the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It falls under our <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#18-we-reserve-the-right-to-maintain-the-plugin-directory-to-the-best-of-our-ability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">18th guideline</a>:</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to NOT close a plugin and grant exceptions.</p>\n<p>Closing plugins is ALWAYS a tricky thing. We regularly warn, and do not close, larger plugins as closing them would have an adverse impact on the entire WordPress community. Closing plugins with 500,000 users can be more harmful than helpful, even when there are security problems. The more users a plugin gets, the more difficult it is to weigh the risks of closing versus not closing.</p>\n<p>Maintaining the trust in larger plugins is as important as doing so with the directory as a whole. With so many outlets wanting to spin up FUD and blast outrage at everyone involved as their first reaction, we try to stem the tide a little and not act like the sky is falling all the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jetpack has more than 5 million active installs. If it is found to be in violation of the guidelines, it is not likely to be removed due to the impact it would have on millions of WordPress users, not to mention the hosts who have it pre-installed on WordPress hosting plans. </p>\n<p>The discussion regarding how WordPress can improve the implementation of feature suggestions on the plugin screen for all plugins is happening in a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> on trac opened by Joost de Valk. This ticket does not debate whether or not feature suggestions are a good idea in general but rather focuses on how results can better communicate that a feature is already active or available. de Valk shared a screenshot of what the screen currently looks like when a user searches for a plugin for which they already have a match installed:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/active-plugin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The disabled &#8216;Active&#8217; button there is not very useful, as it doesn&#8217;t provide any context as to why that button is disabled,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to propose a change: let&#8217;s turn this into two separate groups of results, one that says &#8216;these plugins you already have installed might be able to help&#8217; and then a second group below that with other plugins.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tim Hengeveld posted a mockup of what an implementation of that might look like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mockup-plugin-screen.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The topic of feature suggestions on this screen is still highly controversial, despite the Plugin Team confirming that it is not breaking the guidelines (as long as plugins don&#8217;t promote paid upgrades). Plugin authors have worked for years towards better rankings on this screen by providing quality support and updates that translate into better ratings and more installs. Any mega plugin that offers multiple modules packed into one can easily usurp these rankings by suggesting its own features and having them automatically appear in that top slot.

Michael Waterfall, iOS Engineer at ASOS, tested the &#8220;kill switch&#8221; function and demonstrated that it still works with prior versions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It also confirms they lied. They _still_ have the ability to wipe any blog that hasn\'t updated to the new plugin version (4.8.0), which they hurriedly released to delete the kill switch after they were exposed the other day. <a href=\"https://t.co/bNMfRQUBpr\">pic.twitter.com/bNMfRQUBpr</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Michael Waterfall (@mwaterfall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwaterfall/status/1112445109755359233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Veenstra&#8217;s investigation also uncovered questionable remote calls in the plugin&#8217;s cron events, undisclosed content and configuration rewrites, and a list of popular plugins that are immediately deactivated when P3 is activated, without the user&#8217;s knowledge. He found that some of these plugins are deactivated alongside admin_init, so any user attempts to reactivate the plugins will not stick.</p>\n<p>Wordfence estimates the P3 plugin to have an install base of 10,000-15,000 sites. The changes made in version 4.8.0 of the plugin are not transparently identified in the changelog, so it&#8217;s not easy for users to know what has changed. The content filtering and the plugin deactivations remain in the most recent release. These types of veiled functions performed without permission could have unintended consequences on sites using the plugin, which non-technical users may not be able to fix themselves.</p>\n<h3>Pipdig P3 Plugin Performed a DDoS Attack on a Competitor&#8217;s Site</h3>\n<p>Jem Turner, a freelance web developer based in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/2019/security-alert-pipdig-insecure-ddosing-competitors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a lengthy analysis of the P3 plugin</a> the same day that Wordfence released its analysis. She drilled down further into the remote requests, demonstrating how Pipdig has been using the P3 plugin to perform a DDoS attack on a competitor who also provides WordPress themes and installation services to bloggers. The code triggers an hourly cron job on users&#8217; sites, effectively using their customers&#8217; servers to send malicious requests to the competitor&#8217;s site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The code comment tells us this is “checking the CDN (content delivery network) cache”. It’s not. This is performing a GET request on a file (id39dqm3c0_license_h.txt) sat on pipdigz.co.uk, which yesterday morning returned ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ in the response body.</p>\n<p>Every single hour night and day, without any manual intervention, any blogger running the pipdig plugin will send a request with a faked User Agent to ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ with a random number string attached. This is effectively performing a small scale DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) on kotrynabassdesign.com’s server.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Turner also contacted <a href=\"http://kotrynabassdesign.com’\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kotryna Bass</a>, Pipdig&#8217;s competitor, who said she had contacted her host after finding that her admin-ajax.php file was under some kind of attack. Bass&#8217; exchanges with her host are also published in Turner&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>Turner&#8217;s post explained how Pipdig&#8217;s P3 plugin code manipulated links to point to their own products and services when a user includes a link to a competitor in the the content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here we have pipdig’s plugin searching for mentions of ‘blogerize.com‘ with the string split in two and rejoined – concatenated – to make it harder to find mentions of competitors when doing a mass ‘Find in Files’ across the plugin (amongst other things). When the plugin finds links to blogerize.com in blogger’s content (posts, pages), they’re swapped out with a link to ‘pipdig.co/shop/blogger-to-wordpress-migration/’ i.e. pipdig’s own blog migration services. Swapping these links out boost the SEO benefit to pipdig, and the vast majority of bloggers wouldn’t notice the switcheroo (especially as if the page/post was edited, the link to blogerize would appear in the backend as normal).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The plugin did not ask users&#8217; permission before performing any of these actions and most of them were implemented with obfuscated code. Turner&#8217;s investigation also covers how the P3 plugin could harvest data and change admin passwords. Many of the findings overlap with Wordfence&#8217;s analysis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was aware that Wordfence had been contacted for an opinion, although I was unaware they were writing a post and vice versa,&#8221; Turner said. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t surprised that they wrote about it though, given the risk to WordPress users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She has been in contact with authorities regarding Pipdig&#8217;s unethical coding practices and privacy violations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From my side of things, I&#8217;ve been in contact with Action Fraud (submitted a report through their website) and NCSC (who pointed me back to Action Fraud and gave me a number to call). From pipdig&#8217;s side, there are threats of legal action in their blog post but I&#8217;ve received nothing yet.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Pipdig&#8217;s Public Response Skirts Critical Concerns</h3>\n<p>Pipdig Creative Director Phil Clothier <a href=\"https://www.pipdig.co/blog/sad-times/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a public response</a> from the company which opens by characterizing the recent investigations as &#8220;various accusations and rumours spreading about pipdig&#8221; and includes an emotional plea regarding how  distressing recent developments have been for his company. He claims that his team and their supporters are being harassed. </p>\n<p>After pushing out the 4.8.0 version of the P3 plugin, removing some but not all of the offensive code, Clothier opts for a Q&#038;A style format for his post, putting every question in the present tense:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do you DDOS competitors?<br />\nNo.</p>\n<p>Do you “kill” sites?<br />\nNo!</p>\n<p>Do you have the ability to kill sites via the pipdig Power Pack?<br />\nNo</p></blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the &#8220;kill switch&#8221; feature they built in, which detects all tables with the WordPress prefix and drops each of them, Clothier said it was simply a function to reset a site back to its default settings. He deliberately misrepresented what it does: </p>\n<blockquote><p>There was function in an older version of the plugin which could be used to reset a site back to the default settings. This function had no risk of of malicious or unintentional use. I can say categorically that there was no risk to your site if you were using a pipdig theme. This feature has been dug up and labelled a “Kill Switch” for maximum negative impact on us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clothier claims the function was available in the P3 plugin in July 2018 when a third party started posting Pipdig themes for sale on their own site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A 3rd party was able to download all of our themes illegitimately and post them on a clone of our own site. This included previews of our themes and the ability to purchase them. We were first alerted to this by people which had purchased a pipdig theme from there, but were finding that certain features did not work correctly. After investigation, we found that the victim had purchased the theme from the 3rd party, thinking it was us. The 3rd party not only gained the financial benefit of the theme payment, but also used it as a way to inject malware and ads into the victim’s site. The reset function was put in place in order to remove the 3rd party’s ability to host preview sites with our themes. It worked, and they have since disappeared. The function was then removed in a later version of the plugin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a false claim, as Wordfence pointed out in an updated <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/04/pipdig-update-dishonest-denials-erased-evidence-and-ongoing-offenses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. The first instance of the code responsible for database deletion was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190331195426/https://bitbucket.org/pipdig/p3/commits/edc47824200e15d64cab7270debc4a0526a8d323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">committed to the plugin in November 2017</a>. </p>\n<p>The company failed to address the most critical concerns presented in the Wordfence analysis in its first pass at issuing a public statement. Instead, on the matter of coordinating a DDoS attack on competitors, Pipdig blames users and suggests they may have added the competitor&#8217;s URL to their sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re now looking into why this function is returning this url,&#8221; Clothier said. &#8220;However, it seems to suggest that some of the &#8216;Author URLs&#8217; have been set to ‘kotrynabassdesign.com’. We don’t currently know why this is the case, or whether the site owner has intentionally changed this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/04/pipdig-update-dishonest-denials-erased-evidence-and-ongoing-offenses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Further investigations</a> published by Wordfence today showed that Pipdig also added DDoS code to its Blogger templates and was actively issuing malicious requests up until yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the investigation of Pipdig’s WordPress plugin and themes, we also came across some curious code associated with their Blogger themes. This code is part of Pipdig’s suspected DDoS campaign against their competitor, and was active until April 1, four days after Pipdig’s denial of any such behavior.</p>\n<p>Some of Pipdig’s Blogger themes have been confirmed to make external JavaScript calls to Pipdig’s server, specifically to the script hXXps://pipdigz[.]co[.]uk/js/zeplin1.js.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On March 31, as the investigations became public, Pipdig deleted its public Bitbucket repository and replaced it with a &#8220;clean one,&#8221; removing three years of commit history. Wordfence and many others cloned the repository before it was deleted and saved snapshots of pages to cite in the investigation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That clean repository <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pipdig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pipdig</a> published earlier today in place of the one containing all of their malicious code&#8230; They changed the reported release date of version 4.8.0. <a href=\"https://t.co/YqKASTUZE7\">pic.twitter.com/YqKASTUZE7</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Nicky Bloor (@nickstadb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickstadb/status/1112796890855325697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pipdig&#8217;s public statement contains a number of other false claims that are outlined in Wordfence&#8217;s followup piece with code examples. Clothier closes the article by casting aspersion on the press, presumably to encourage customers not to trust what they read from other sources.</p>\n<p>I contacted Pipdig for their comment on recent events, but Clothier declined to answer any of my questions. One of those was why the plugin disables Bluehost&#8217;s caching plugin without informing customers. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Another one from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pipdig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pipdig</a> plugin.

However we also contend that the previous versions had no serious issues too.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pipdig declined to answer questions about licensing but the products <a href=\"https://support.pipdig.co/license/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">do not appear to be GPL-licensed</a>. This may be why the company deemed it within its rights to take action on those who they believe to have &#8220;stolen&#8221; their themes.  </p>\n<h3>Pipdig Customers Share Mixed Reactions to Reports of Vendor Backdoors and DDoS Attacks</h3>\n<p>In what is perhaps one of the most brazen abuses I&#8217;ve ever seen from a theme company in WordPress&#8217; history, Pipdig&#8217;s user base has unknowingly been used to target the company&#8217;s competitors. Regardless of the company&#8217;s motive in combatting the unauthorized distribution of their themes, these types of backdoors and undisclosed content rewrites are indefensible. They prey upon user trust and in this case the victims were primarily bloggers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think that\'s why so many of us are so angry.

Without full knowledge of the inner workings of a product, many customers make decisions based on how they feel about a company, regardless of being confronted with facts that should cause them to question their experiences.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m not concerned.

If you are a Pipdig customer affected by this incident, there is no assurance that the company will not build more backdoors into your site in the future. The plugin updates are not reviewed by any kind of authority. Fortunately, there are a few actions you can take to create a safer environment for your website. </p>\n<p>First, look for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-licensing-the-gpl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GPL-licensed themes and plugins</a>, because they grant you more freedoms as the user and are compatible with WordPress&#8217; legal license.

Thinking of it, I found it to be one of the most fortunate things I had in my career and life. I can do what I love, can make money to support myself, my family and have many good friends.</p>\n<p>When I found out about WordPress, I was still a second-year student at the university. The major I studied was not IT but mechanical engineering. I chose it with the desire to get a scholarship abroad (it was in Russia). But in the process of learning, I found myself inclined to and more passionate about coding. Therefore, I taught myself coding.</p>\n<p>In my second year of university, I wanted to set up a website to download software. It is not a very proud thing, because at that time I just wanted to share the software with everyone, including free software and pirated software (software pirating is still a big problem in Russia and in Vietnam). It can be said that software was what attracted me the most at that time. I was passionate about finding new software, testing, running them, finding great features and sharing experiences with people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At that time, the web was still something very new to me and I didn’t have many concepts about it. I just needed to find a free platform to build a blog about software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At that time, there were two platforms that caught my attention &#8211; WordPress and BoBlog. BoBlog was a Chinese platform (it’s dead now), and WordPress seemed more international, so I chose WordPress.</p>\n<p>It can be said that the choice of WordPress has made me learn more seriously about the web and related technologies. By editing the theme, making additional features for my blog, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. During my time at the university, I had been exploring these things and gradually improving my knowledge base.</p>\n<p>For me, the web has a big advantage comparing to other software, which is any line of code you write, you can see the result right in the browser by just pressing F5. This was the point that I was very excited about because when I tried coding in other languages, the compiling process made me feel time-consuming and not very intuitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Start_My_Own_Blog_10\">Start My Own Blog</h3>\n<p>After that, I felt that the knowledge I learned was quite interesting and wanted to share it with everyone. So I started my personal blog, it is still active at <a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/deluxeblogtips.com\">deluxeblogtips.com</a>. Blogging is an important thing in my career, maybe the most. It brings a lot of fortunate to me:</p>\n<p><strong>English:</strong> English is not my native language. But by blogging, my reading and communication skill in English has improved significantly. Although there are still many errors, I feel quite confident when talking to international friends. This has been happening for a long time and I am very grateful for it.</p>\n<p><strong>The first freelance jobs:</strong> Blogging has been around for a while, some people knew about me thanks to my helpful sharing. And they started contacting me and asked if I wanted to work for them. At that time, as a student, I was very happy, because I could earn some money. Later, when I graduated from university, I started my career with those freelance jobs. I did freelancing for about 4-5 years since 2010. I participated in many projects, learned a lot of things and knew a lot of friends. During this time, I also gathered a group of Vietnamese friends to work on those freelance jobs. Until now, although the group is no longer available, we are still good friends and still meet often.</p>\n<p><strong>Start ideas for products:</strong> precisely <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>. This is my company’s flagship product at the moment. Its idea started from my tutorial on the blog. Thanks to those sharing, it’s now a plugin of 400,000 active installs that based on a tutorial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Community_20\">Community</h3>\n<p>Blogging makes many people known about me. And my share (and other products) is also useful for many people and thanks to that, I connect with many developers around the world and in Vietnam. In 2012, when Philip Author Moore came to Vietnam, we met the first time, and it was a “fateful” meeting between us. Together, we built the WordPress community in Vietnam from those early years, started the Hanoi WordPress Meetup and shared a lot of things about WordPress. There were many companies in Vietnam starting to redirect and working on WordPress from such meetup sessions.</p>\n<p>So far, the community has been strong and we are no longer involved because we’re quite busy and we do not have too much experience in organizing and maintaining offline activities. Online activities are still very exciting thanks to Facebook!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Building_products_and_company_26\">Building products and company</h3>\n<p>Being a developer and having the opportunity to work on projects with customers, in 2010, I found many things missing from WordPress. And at that time, I had the idea of <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>, which is a developer framework to quickly create custom fields. I shared a series of tutorials on my blog. What I didn’t expect was that there were so many people having the same interest.</p>\n<p>After that, I continuously upgraded the plugin, based on feedback from other users and developers. I also get a lot of help from other developers, especially <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/unserkaiser\">Kaiser</a>. I am really grateful to them because, without them, Meta Box could not become a plugin with 400,000 active installs.</p>\n<p>When I first developed the plugin, I didn’t have much idea about commercializing it. All were free. At that time, I didn’t know much about interacting on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a> and the Trac system, so I released the code on Google Code. A long time later, I uploaded it to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/\">wordpress.org</a>. Therefore, when comparing the custom fields plugins, Meta Box is sometimes not considered the first plugin, while it should be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea of Meta Box was later inherited by many people and developed similar plugins. And I really like that, because that’s the idea of open source!</p></blockquote>\n<p>The success of Meta Box was the basis for me to establish my own company &#8211; <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a> to develop products for WordPress.</p>\n<p>In addition to Meta Box, while creating a freelance team, we also tried to become a theme provider and joined ThemeForest. It was not very successful, because I feel ThemeForest is a battlefield in which the parties race to add features to make a theme become powerful, able to do many things and therefore very bloated and not optimal. As a developer, I always feel uncomfortable with those things.</p>\n<p>The theme work then was separated into two brands of our company: <a href=\"https://fitwp.com\">FitWP</a> for themes on ThemeForest and <a href=\"https://gretathemes.com\">GretaThemes</a> for themes that are simple, optimal and serve a specific purpose. Currently, the focus of our company are Meta Box and GretaThemes.</p>\n<p>And for freelance work, we moved into a division of our company that specializes in <a href=\"https://elightup.com/projects/\">projects with customers</a>. We carry out projects for both domestic and international customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The_shift_in_roles_44\">The shift in roles</h3>\n<p>Before establishing the company, the income from the products and projects helped me and my family have a comfortable life in Vietnam. But for a long time in the WordPress community, I’ve seen many brands that I’ve always admired, especially WooThemes (now merged into Automattic). Seeing their great contributions to the community, I always want to do the same. And to do that, it’s difficult to do as an individual. So I founded <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a>, wishing to create good products and contribute to the community.</p>\n<p>When I founded the company, I did not measure all the management issues or predicted that. I had to learn a lot, from managing people, resources, finance to strategy, market research and marketing. As a developer, they are all new and challenging things. There were times when I was very stressful because I had to do both developing products and other work which were not my strength.</p>\n<p>So far, things have gotten better, I have become more comfortable to work, although I still have to code and manage at the same time.</p>\n<p>Above all, I see what I have now is big luck, and that is totally love and support from the community for me. Therefore, no matter how difficult or challenging things are, I still feel very happy with what I have and will try to do better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vietnamese\">Tiếng Việt</h2>\n<p>Đã 13 năm kể từ khi tôi biết đến WordPress lần đầu tiên. Nghĩ lại, tôi thấy đó là một trong những điều may mắn nhất mà tôi có được trong sự nghiệp và cuộc sống của mình. Tôi được làm điều mà tôi yêu thích, có thể kiếm tiền nuôi sống được bản thân, gia đình và có thêm nhiều bạn bè tốt.</p>\n<p>Khi tôi biết đến WordPress, tôi vẫn còn là 1 cậu sinh viên năm thứ 2. Chuyên ngành mà tôi học không phải là IT mà là cơ khí chế tạo máy. Tôi đã chọn chuyên ngành đó với mong muốn có được 1 suất học bổng ở nước ngoài, khi đó là ở Nga. Nhưng trong quá trình học tập, tôi thấy mình có thiên hướng và đam mê về lập trình nhiều hơn. Vì thế, tôi đã tự học và bổ sung các kiến thức về IT cho mình.</p>\n<p>Năm thứ 2 đại học, tôi muốn lập 1 website về download phần mềm. Cũng không phải là một điều tự hào gì lắm, vì lúc đó tôi chỉ muốn chia sẻ các phần mềm với mọi người, trong đó có phần mềm miễn phí và có cả phần mềm crack (vấn nạn crack phần mềm ở Nga và ở Việt Nam vẫn còn rất lớn). Có thể nói phần mềm là thứ thu hút tôi lúc đó nhiều nhất. Tôi say mê tìm phần mềm mới, thử nghiệm, chạy chúng, tìm các tính năng hay và chia sẻ kinh nghiệm với mọi người. Lúc đó, web vẫn còn là một thứ gì đó rất thô sơ và tôi cũng chưa có nhiều khái niệm về nó. Tôi loay hoay tìm một nền tảng có sẵn để xây dựng một blog về phần mềm. Vào thời điểm đó, có 2 nền tảng đã gây sự chú ý với tôi &#8211; đó là WordPress và BoBlog. BoBlog là 1 blog của Trung Quốc, còn WordPress thì có vẻ quốc tế hơn, nên tôi đã chọn WordPress.</p>\n<p>Có thể nói sự lựa chọn WordPress đã khiến tôi học hỏi nghiêm túc hơn về web và các công nghệ liên quan. Bằng cách chỉnh sửa giao diện, làm thêm các tính năng bổ sung cho blog của mình mà tôi đã học được nhiều điều về HTML, CSS, JavaScript và PHP. Trong suốt thời gian học đại học, tôi đã mày mò những cái này và dần hoàn thiện nền tảng kiến thức của mình.</p>\n<p>Đối với tôi, web có 1 điểm hơn các phần mềm khác, đó là bất kỳ dòng code nào mà bạn viết, bạn có thể thấy kết quả của nó ngay trên trình duyệt (chỉ với 1 lần nhấn F5). Đây là điểm mà tôi rất thích thú, vì trước đó tôi đã thử lập trình trên một số ngôn ngữ khác, nhưng quá trình biên dịch khiến tôi cảm thấy mất thời gian và không trực quan lắm.</p>\n<h3>Bắt đầu viết blog</h3>\n<p>Sau đó, tôi cảm thấy những kiến thức mà tôi học hỏi được cũng khá thú vị và muốn chia sẻ nó với mọi người. Và tôi bắt đầu viết blog để chia sẻ. Blog của tôi đến nay vẫn hoạt động tại <a href=\"http://deluxeblogtips.com\">deluxeblogtips.com</a>. Có thể nói viết blog là bước ngoặt quan trọng trong sự nghiệp của tôi. Nó đã giúp tôi có được nhiều thứ quyết định trong sự nghiệp của mình:</p>\n<p><strong>Tiếng Anh:</strong> tiếng Anh vốn không phải là ngôn ngữ mẹ đẻ của tôi. Nhưng nhờ trau dồi viết blog mà khả năng đọc hiểu và trao đổi bằng tiếng Anh của tôi tiến bộ rõ rệt. Mặc dù còn nhiều lỗi, nhưng tôi cảm thấy khá tự tin khi nói chuyện với bạn bè quốc tế. Việc này xảy ra trong khoảng thời gian dài và tôi rất biết ơn điều đó.</p>\n<p><strong>Những công việc freelance đầu tiên:</strong> Viết blog được 1 khoảng thời gian, nhờ những chia sẻ có ích của mình mà một số người đã biết đến tôi. Và họ bắt đầu contact với tôi và hỏi xem tôi có muốn làm việc cho họ không. Lúc đó, với 1 sinh viên thì tôi rất vui mừng, vì có thể kiếm được chút ít tiền. Về sau này, khi tôi tốt nghiệp đại học, tôi đã bắt đầu sự nghiệp của mình bằng những công việc freelance đó. Tôi đã làm freelance trong suốt khoảng 4-5 năm kể từ 2010. Tôi đã được tham gia nhiều dự án, học hỏi được rất nhiều điều và biết được thêm rất nhiều bạn bè. Trong khoảng thời gian này, tôi cũng đã tập hợp được 1 số bạn bè cùng làm WordPress tại Việt Nam thành 1 nhóm và cùng làm các công việc freelance đó. Đến nay, tuy nhóm cũ không còn, nhưng chúng tôi vẫn là những người bạn tốt và vẫn hay thường xuyên gặp nhau.</p>\n<p><strong>Bắt đầu ý tưởng cho các sản phẩm:</strong> cụ thể là <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>. Đây là sản phẩm flagship của công ty của tôi hiện tại. Ý tưởng của nó bắt nguồn từ những chia sẻ của tôi trên blog. Nhờ những chia sẻ đó mà tôi đã xây dựng 1 sản phẩm được 400.000 người sử dụng với gốc là từ 1 bài tutorial.</p>\n<h3>Cộng đồng</h3>\n<p>Viết blog khiến nhiều người biết đến tôi. Và những chia sẻ của tôi (và cả các sản phẩm nữa) cũng có ích cho nhiều người và nhờ đó tôi cũng kết nối được với nhiều bạn developer trên thế giới và ở Việt Nam. Năm 2012, khi anh Philip Author Moore tới Việt Nam, chúng tôi đã gặp nhau lần đầu tiên, và đó là buổi gặp “định mệnh” giữa chúng tôi. Cả 2 chúng tôi đã xây dựng cộng đồng WordPress Việt Nam từ những năm đầu đó, cùng start Hanoi WordPress meetup và chia sẻ rất nhiều điều về WordPress. Có rất nhiều công ty ở Việt Nam bắt đầu chuyển hướng và làm về WordPress từ những buổi meetup như vậy.</p>\n<p>Đến nay, cộng đồng đã vững mạnh và chúng tôi không còn tham gia nhiều nữa vì công việc khá bận rộn và bản thân chúng tôi cũng không có quá nhiều kinh nghiệm trong việc tổ chức và duy trì các hoạt động offline. Các hoạt động online thì vẫn diễn ra rất sôi động nhờ vào Facebook!</p>\n<h3>Xây dựng sản phẩm và công ty</h3>\n<p>Vốn là 1 developer và đã có cơ hội làm việc với các dự án với khách hàng, vào những năm 2010, tôi thấy có nhiều điều còn thiếu trong WordPress. Và lúc đó, tôi đã có ý tưởng về <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>, là một framework giúp developer tạo nhanh các custom fields. Tôi đã chia sẻ 1 loạt bài tutorial về việc xây dựng nó trên blog của mình. Và điều tôi không ngờ lúc đó là có rất nhiều người có cùng mối quan tâm như vậy.</p>\n<p>Sau đó, tôi đã liên tục nâng cấp plugin, dựa theo những phản hồi của các developer khác. Tôi cũng nhận được sự giúp đỡ rất nhiều của các bạn developer khác, mà trong đó không thể không nhắc tới <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/unserkaiser\">Kaiser</a>. Tôi thực sự rất biết ơn các bạn, cả những người dùng nữa, vì không có các bạn thì Meta Box đã không thể trở thành 1 plugin với 400.000 lượt active installs được.</p>\n<p>Khi mới phát triển plugin, tôi chưa có ý niệm nhiều về thương mại hoá nó. Toàn bộ đều được chia sẻ miễn phí. Lúc đó, tôi cũng chưa biết nhiều về tương tác trên <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a> với hệ thống Trac, nên tôi release code trên Google Code. Mãi sau này tôi mới đưa lên <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a>. Vì thế nên nhiều khi so sánh tuổi đời của các plugin về custom fields, Meta Box đôi khi không được coi là plugin đầu tiên, trong khi đúng ra là nó phải là như vậy.</p>\n<p>Ý tưởng của Meta Box sau này còn được nhiều người kế thừa và phát triển ra các plugin tương tự. Và tôi rất thích điều đó, vì đó là tư tưởng của open source!</p>\n<p>Sự thành công của Meta Box là cơ sở để tôi thành lập công ty của riêng mình &#8211; <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a> để phát triển các sản phẩm cho WordPress.</p>\n<p>Ngoài Meta Box, trong khi thành lập nhóm làm freelance, chúng tôi cũng đã thử dấn thân vào mảng làm theme và đã tham gia ThemeForest. Có thể nói là mảng đó không được thành công lắm, vì tôi cảm thấy ThemeForest là một chiến trường trong đó các bên đua nhau thêm những tính năng để cho 1 theme trở nên mạnh mẽ, làm được nhiều thứ và do đó rất nặng nề và không tối ưu. Mà tôi là 1 developer nên luôn cảm thấy không thoải mái với những điều đó.</p>\n<p>Mảng làm theme sau này phân tách ra thành 2 brands của công ty chúng tôi: <a href=\"https://fitwp.com\">FitWP</a> cho những theme trên ThemeForest và <a href=\"https://gretathemes.com\">GretaThemes</a> cho những theme đơn giản, tối ưu và phục vụ 1 mục đích cụ thể. Hiện nay thì trọng tâm của công ty chúng tôi là Meta Box và GretaThemes.</p>\n<p>Còn mảng làm freelance sau này chúng tôi tách thành một nhánh trong công ty của chúng tôi là chuyên làm các <a href=\"https://elightup.com/projects/\">dự án với khách hàng</a>. Chúng tôi thực hiện các dự án cho cả khách hàng trong nước và quốc tế.</p>\n<h3>Sự chuyển dịch vai trò</h3>\n<p>Trước khi thành lập công ty, nguồn thu nhập mà các sản phẩm và dự án mang lại cũng đã giúp tôi và gia đình có 1 cuộc sống khá thoải mái ở Việt Nam. Nhưng ở trong cộng đồng WordPress đã lâu, tôi đã thấy rất nhiều brand mà khiến tôi luôn ngưỡng mộ, trong đó nổi bật là WooThemes (nay đã không còn nữa). Thấy các đóng góp to lớn của họ cho cộng đồng, tôi cũng mong muốn mình làm được những điều tương tự. Và để làm việc đó, sức lực của 1 cá nhân rất khó. Nên tôi đã thành lập <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a>, với mong muốn tạo ra những sản phẩm tốt, đóng góp cho cộng đồng và cả những đóng góp miễn phí nữa.</p>\n<p>Khi thành lập công ty, tôi đã không lường được hết những vấn đề về mặt quản lý công ty. Tôi đã phải học rất nhiều điều, từ việc quản lý con người, nguồn lực, tài chính đến những vấn đề về định hướng, chiến lược, nghiên cứu thị trường, marketing. Đối với 1 developer, đây đều là những thứ mới mẻ và thách thức. Có những khoảng thời gian tôi đã rất áp lực, vì vừa phải phát triển sản phẩm, vừa phải làm những công việc khác vốn không phải là thế mạnh của mình.</p>\n<p>Đến nay, mọi thứ đã tốt hơn, tôi đã quen dần hơn với công việc, mặc dù tôi vẫn phải code và quản lý cùng một lúc.</p>\n<p>Nhưng mà, trên tất cả, tôi thấy những gì mà mình có được bây giờ đều là sự may mắn, và đó đều là sự yêu thương, support từ cộng đồng đã dành cho tôi. Bởi thế, cho dù mọi thứ có khó khăn, thách thức như thế nào, tôi vẫn cảm thấy rất vui với những gì mình đang có, và sẽ cố gắng để làm mọi thứ tốt hơn.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Growing%20a%20WordPress%20business%20in%20Vietnam&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F&title=Growing+a+WordPress+business+in+Vietnam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040319-min-150x150.jpg&description=Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/\" title=\"Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/\">Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Apr 2019 02:00:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Anh Tran\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 7.1 Adds Feature Suggestions to Plugin Search Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88404\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10445:\"<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/03/05/jetpack-7-1-business-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 7.1</a> was released earlier this month with new blocks for WordAds, Business Hours, Contact Info, Slideshows, and Videos.

I see the future of these suggestions to be used by plugin authors to keep their product first in certain plugin search terms for upsells like admin notices. </p>\n<p>What do you think about this? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontHijackWPAdmin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DontHijackWPAdmin</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TERjrPgEt6\">pic.twitter.com/TERjrPgEt6</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Mehul Gohil (@mehul_gohil0810) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehul_gohil0810/status/1110488258587308033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Manipulating search results, even to insert an artificial result, using a plugin that is already installed, is a major new development among plugins hosted on WordPress.org. Automattic is setting a precedent for other plugin authors that want to recommend their own add-ons or extensions when users match certain search terms. </p>\n<p>In the feature&#8217;s initial <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/10611\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proof of concept</a>, Jetpack product lead Beau Lebens explained the motivation behind adding suggestions to the search screen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve seen that people with Jetpack installed and activated often search for Jetpack features (even by name) in the Plugins > Add New screen in wp-admin. This new module attempts to spot those searches, and provide an artificial search result that calls out that what they&#8217;re looking for is in Jetpack, which they already have, and which is already active.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eight years since its initial release, Jetpack has grown to 45 modules. Most users are not familiar with everything the plugin offers. In fact, many users may not have even installed Jetpack themselves, as it often comes pre-installed with hosting. The suggestions may prevent users from adding alternate third-party plugins, as Jetpack&#8217;s module placement in the results subtly implies that these are inferior options to its existing modules. </p>\n<p>One of the reasons the feature has many developers rattled is because the UI fails to make it clear that this is an artificial result and not something generated by the plugin directory&#8217;s algorithm. Although it is intended to function more as a notice, for the regular user, it is virtually indistinguishable from an advertisement in its current implementation. It hasn&#8217;t been live for very long, but over time it may even make it more difficult for plugin developers to offer plugins that compete with Jetpack features.</p>\n<p>The feature suggestions in plugin search results became a hot topic on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status</a>&#8216; Slack where Automattic&#8217;s Gary Pendergast dropped in to reiterate the Jetpack team&#8217;s intentions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been talking to some folks on Jetpack about what’s going on,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;I think the team’s end goal is pretty good, and it solves a real problem WordPress has. Too often, site owners install masses of plugins that they don’t need, which ultimately creates all sorts of security, performance, and stability issues. In this particular use case, if a site owner is looking for functionality that Jetpack already handles, then the owner should be aware of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast also said he thinks WordPress core should offer an API for any plugin to be able to do something similar.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Team Says Jetpack&#8217;s Artificial Search Results Do Not Break WordPress.org Guidelines</h3>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s easy to conjure up different ways to abuse this avenue for advertising a plugin&#8217;s existing features, WordPress.org&#8217;s plugin team is ready to deal with a potential influx of various implementations on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really advertising anything &#8211; it&#8217;s just adding search results for pieces of a plugin that you already have and might not know about, so it&#8217;s not really against any rules,&#8221; Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;If it was misleading in some manner, then that would be different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood said the team discussed it but concluded that any implementation of something similar in other plugins will need to be reviewed to see if it&#8217;s doing anything misleading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Realistically it&#8217;s always going to be a judgment call of some sort,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;For example, if a plugin was to insert search results for other plugins, then that wouldn&#8217;t be okay, because it&#8217;s misleading. But, this isn&#8217;t that case. It&#8217;s just trying to say &#8216;hey, you have a plugin already installed which does what you&#8217;re looking for,&#8217; so it&#8217;s trying to be helpful in that respect. It may not necessarily be the best way of accomplishing that goal, admittedly. But it&#8217;s pretty valid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood did not place a hard requirement on having the artificial result be dismissible but said anytime a developer inserts something into a screen where would not normally be, having dismiss functionality is good UX. He doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s likely that many other plugin authors will implement something similar since most are not collections of dozens of plugins and add-ons. However, this type of suggestion seems like it would also be applicable to block collection plugins that include dozens of Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be really difficult for users when all the essential plugin authors implement it,&#8221; Gohil said in response to comments on the screenshot he tweeted. &#8220;They are using JS to hack into plugin search using hook &#8216;admin_enqueue_scripts&#8217; and that&#8217;s not good. I&#8217;m not in favor of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If more plugin authors begin adding suggestions, users could see several rows of artificial results before seeing any real ones, depending on which plugins they have installed. Plugin developers are already brainstorming ways to strip the feature suggestions out. It likely will not be long before plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hide-jetpack-promotions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hide Jetpack Promotions</a> removes the artificial search results to maintain results as delivered by WordPress.org. </p>\n<p>Wood said the plugin team does not intend to write any new guidelines for plugin authors creating their own implementations of feature suggestions on the search screen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The difference is always going to be one of intent,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;It&#8217;s JP&#8217;s intent here to notify the user of the existence of a feature they may not know about. That&#8217;s trying to be helpful to the user, not trying to shut out competition. It doesn&#8217;t remove search results. It doesn&#8217;t reorder them or filter them. It just adds a card about the feature you&#8217;re searching for. If you don&#8217;t have JP, then it can&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s not advertising for other plugins or anything like that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack is also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/361a99f6ae70152b52142aa682c8a6c25b5afc04/modules/plugin-search.php#L291-L292\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tracking search terms longer than three characters</a>, and Wood confirmed that this is also within the guidelines, as long as it is disclosed to the user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole tracking module doesn&#8217;t activate until after you agree to the ToS thingy, so honestly, it&#8217;s allowed,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;They track lots of things for stats and such. Realistically, so do many other plugins. As long as you ask the user first, before tracking anything, then tracking data is allowed. Opt-in is the rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood said he found the search term tracking to be unnecessary since WordPress.org already collects this information through its new search system that runs on ElasticSearch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We get all the search terms on the WordPress.org servers, anyway, so both we and they kinda already have them,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;Automatticians built our newest plugin search engine, after all. It seems kind of a waste to track them using Jetpack when they literally receive all the searches to run through the search engine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack’s artificial search results, although dismissible, take up the top spot, bypassing the algorithm altogether. It gives the appearance that Jetpack&#8217;s built-in feature is either a promoted listing or superior to all other options available in the directory. </p>\n<p>Although a suggested module may work more harmoniously with other Jetpack features than a third-party plugin, the modules are built to be fairly general in terms of features. They address the basic needs for the largest number of users but rarely provide more options than a standalone plugin dedicated to performing something similar. Users may very well be searching for a replacement for what Jetpack provides. The ability to easily turn off suggestions in search results with a toggle could go a long way for diplomacy. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 15:40:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Automattic Launches Happy Tools Product Line for Distributed Teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88372\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-happy-tools-product-line-for-distributed-teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3144:\"<p>Automattic has <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/happy-tools-the-future-of-work/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> Happy Schedule, the first in a new line of products called &#8220;<a href=\"https://happy.tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Tools</a>,&#8221; created to solve problems for distributed teams. The products have grown out of internal tools that Automattic uses with its distributed team of more than 850 employees in 68 countries. </p>\n<p>Most employee scheduling tools are designed for more traditional work environments where people report to work in person in the same timezone. <a href=\"https://happy.tools/#products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Schedule</a> allows employees to set their own flexible schedules all the way down to 15-minute increments, seamlessly managing timezones for team members in one calendar. Automattic uses it to manage 24-hour global support with its 300+ Happiness Engineers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/happy-schedule.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Happy Tools is currently priced at $60/month for 12 users and then $5/user after that. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to Happy Schedule, we&#8217;ll be looking to bring our customer chat tool into Happy Tools,&#8221; Happy Tools product lead Matt Wondra said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also look at other applications Automattic has already built to help with team communication, people-management, and customer support.” </p>\n<p>The product suite complements Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-publishes-ted-talk-on-the-future-of-work-prepares-to-launch-new-distributed-blog-website\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TED talk</a> in which he evangelizes distributed work as &#8220;the future of work.&#8221; Mullenweg predicts that companies will evolve to become distributed first or will soon be replaced by ones that are.</p>\n<p>Beyond simply recognizing the benefits of employees being able to design their own work environments, there are some real challenges to becoming a distributed company. This is especially true for those that didn&#8217;t start out that way. Smaller companies have less experience navigating all the tax laws and legal processes around hiring people from different countries. These hurdles make it difficult to grow an international team and retain employees as anything more than hourly contractors.</p>\n<p>Answering some of these difficult questions gets into the meat of making distributed teams a reality. With its position as one of the few distributed companies that has successfully scaled into the hundreds, Automattic has an opportunity to open source some of its counsel, documents, and HR guides around international hiring. This would be a valuable addition to <a href=\"http://distributed.blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">distributed.blog</a> or the Happy Tools blog that would help more companies move beyond their initial explorations of distributed work and ultimately create a larger market for these kinds of tools.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 04:28:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WordPress.org blog: Minimum PHP Version update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2947:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 is targeted for release at the end of this month, and with it comes an update to the minimum required version of PHP.  WordPress will now require a minimum of PHP 5.6.20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning in WordPress 5.1, users running PHP versions below 5.6 have had a notification in their dashboard that includes <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">information to help them update PHP</a>. Since then, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress stats</a> have shown an increase in users on more recent versions of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-10.30.34-PM.png?resize=632%2C265&ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of the \" />The dashboard widget users see if running an outdated version of PHP \n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your site is running on an unsupported version of PHP, the WordPress updater will not offer WordPress 5.2 to your site. If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 14:51:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Aaron Jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: March 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2019/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7947:\"<p>WordPress reached a significant milestone this month.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release.

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based.

It&#8217;s been four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this post there are 165 essays published. 165 stories of dreams, successes, failures, and courage. 165 people I&#8217;ve gotten to know and love. It feels like it&#8217;s always been there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while this last year I only published once a month, so I could both focus on work a little more as well as draw attention to past essays. A few weeks ago I went back to weekly, and I&#8217;m happy with it. It&#8217;s exciting getting to know a new person every week. Not just meet them, but have good conversation and really get to know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some fun news. The other day <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden?s=17\">Josepha The Magnificent</a> approached me about syndicating HeroPress on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/\">https://wordpress.org/news/</a>. It&#8217;s already on <a href=\"https://planet.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Planet</a> (Thanks Matt!), which is the number one driver of traffic to this site, by FAR. I&#8217;ll be interested to see what being on /news does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often ask me about the future of HeroPress, but I don&#8217;t really see it changing much. Getting syndicated is nice, but doesn&#8217;t really change what I do or publish. We did a <a href=\"https://heropress.com/announcing-up-running-scholarship-heropress-wpshout/\">scholarship giveaway</a> a couple years ago and we&#8217;ve discussed doing it again. I really enjoyed that, I&#8217;d welcome more things like it from other organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To all of you who&#8217;ve read over the years, I thank you.  To all of you who&#8217;ve been transparent and had the courage to let the world see your story, I can&#8217;t thank you enough. Every time someone says to me &#8220;HeroPress is such an encouragement to me&#8221; it&#8217;s because of you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the future, and many more stories.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Four Years\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Four%20Years&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Ffour-years%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Four Years\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Ffour-years%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Ffour-years%2F&title=Four+Years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Four Years\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/four-years/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/plugins/rtsocial/images/default-pinterest.png&description=Four Years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Four Years\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/four-years/\" title=\"Four Years\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/four-years/\">Four Years</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 02:49:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Asia Proposed for 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88339\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-proposed-for-2020-in-bangkok-thailand\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2775:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bangkok.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/eustaquio/9699604924\">Eustaquio Santimano</a>\n<p>The organizers of WordCamp Asia, a brand new regional WordCamp, have published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/03/29/wordcamp-asia-proposal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> for making Bangkok, Thailand, the host city for a 2-3 day event in early 2020. They are currently planning for February or March to avoid clashing with other regional WordCamps (WCEU, WCUS). The camp has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-asia-now-in-planning-for-2018-wordcamp-asia-targeted-for-2019\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">informally discussed since 2015</a> while organizers focused on growing new city-based WordCamps across the region.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamps in Asia have reached a critical mass that will enable a successful regional WordCamp,&#8221; Jon Ang said in the  introduction to the proposal. &#8220;We believe that running this WordCamp will contribute directly to long term efforts in fostering WordPress interest in countries that lack it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Asia organizers are being mentored by lead organizers of WordCamp Europe and have created an official proposal based heavily on the one submitted by WordCamp Nordic organizers. They have submitted it to the broader WordCamp community leaders for review before submitting and official application to WordCamp Central. </p>\n<p>Asia has many vibrant and diverse WordPress communities across distant geographical areas. It technically includes Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey, Israel, and Iran, as well as all of Russia and India and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Hugh Lashbrooke commented on the proposal, asking if it is actually a “WordCamp South-East Asia,&#8221; given all the currently listed organizers are from this region, or if they intend to include other countries beyond this area. Ang said that the event will certainly include leaders from India and Pakistan and they have discussed forming a global team with two representatives from each country. The leaders currently listed in the proposal are those who were specifically involved in drafting it.</p>\n<p>Bangkok is proposed for the first host city due to its relatively affordable location, the ease of obtaining a visa on arrival for attendees from many Asian counties, and the availability of inexpensive flights to most major cities in Asia. The local WordPress community is also experienced at running large WordCamps (500+ attendees) and Bangkok&#8217;s local meetup group has more than 1,500 members. WordCamp Asia organizers are planning for 750-1,000 attendees.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 20:19:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"WPTavern: New Gutenberg Playground Offers a Standalone Version of the Editor for Testing Outside the WordPress Admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88324\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"https://wptavern.com/new-gutenberg-playground-offers-a-standalone-version-of-the-editor-for-testing-outside-the-wordpress-admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1992:\"<p>The Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14497\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">merged a pull request</a> three days ago that adds a local &#8220;playground&#8221; development environment for testing outside of the WordPress admin. Riad Benguella, the technical lead for Gutenberg phase 2, said that the playground could grow over time to contain &#8220;more than just a standalone version of the editor&#8221; and could become a way for developers to test out components in isolation. He shared a screenshot of the playground in action:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gutenberg-playground.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>During Tuesday&#8217;s JavaScript chat meeting, Benguella elaborated on the playground&#8217;s intended use. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re expanding the usage of Gutenberg outside of the edit-post and also talking about cross-CMS usage and external usage (in the broad sense), we need a way to run the block editor in a context independent from the WordPress Admin. This means no WordPress admin styles, no API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Testing Gutenberg in the playground&#8217;s &#8220;no-context&#8221; mode allows developers to ensure their components don&#8217;t rely on  WP-Admin styles to be present. Benguella said it demonstrates how core blocks can be used without requiring a post object, which will be useful for architecting the widgets screen. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This playground could evolve to contain examples of our reusable components (think Storybook),&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;It could also serve as a contributor tool. For example, we could include a way to search for selectors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The playground was just merged this week, so contributors are working on better documentation.

The easiest way is to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Beta Testing</a> plugin and select &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies.&#8221; Try out the new blocks, experiment with turning blocks and and off.

You can report any issues to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha/Beta</a> area in the support forums or <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">log a ticket on trac</a>.</p>\n<p>Developers have a few big items to test as well. Plugin authors can now <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">specify a minimum PHP version</a> that the plugin will support. WordPress is also adding the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45806\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sodium_compat library</a>, a libsodium-compatible cryptography API for PHP 7.2+. </p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/27/dev-chat-summary-march-27/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a> from today&#8217;s core developer chat, there are currently 116 open tickets that contributors plan to address in three betas. The goal is to slash that number down to 66 before beta 2. WordPress 5.2 is targeted for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">April 30, 2019</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 03:36:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6798\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-2-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6940:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.2 Beta two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (choose the “bleeding edge nightlies” option)</li><li>Or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-2/\">April 30</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has received significant performance improvements since WordPress 5.1, shaving 35% off the load time for massive posts, and cutting the keypress time (how responsive it feels when you&#8217;re typing) in half!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility continues to improve, too. The block editor now supports your browser&#8217;s reduced motion settings. The post URL slug has better labelling and help text. The focus styling for keyboard navigating through landmarks is clearer and more consistent. There are a variety of new speak messages, and existing messages have been tweaked for more useful screen-reader behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added several new blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An RSS block</li><li>An Amazon Kindle embed block</li><li>A Search block</li><li>A Calendar block</li><li>A Tag Cloud block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you keep track of these blocks, and only show the ones you need, there&#8217;s a new block management tool to switch blocks on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?fit=632%2C474&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6806\" />Block Management Modal\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on existing blocks, too. There are hundreds of bug fixes and improvements in the block editor, you can read more about them in the Gutenberg plugin releases: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-23th-january/\">4.9</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-february/\">5.0</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/\">5.1</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-march/\">5.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">5.3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The WordPress Mobile Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor isn&#8217;t just for websites, either. The WordPress mobile apps now include an experimental version of a built-in block editor. This is still under development, but you can try it out now!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/\">The block editor is coming to the mobile apps</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phase of this project (originally scoped for WordPress 5.1) is now included in WordPress 5.2. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>). Before, you’d have to FTP in to your files or get in touch with your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">The Improved Fatal Error Protection</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we&#8217;re adding a new Health Check tool to your Dashboard. Visit the <em>Tools</em> menu and click on <em>Health Check</em> to get information that can help improve the speed and security of  your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PHP Version Bump</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">WordPress will increase its minimum supported PHP version to 5.6</a>. To help you check if you&#8217;re prepared for this change, WordPress 5.2 will show you a warning and help you upgrade your version of PHP, if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plugins can now specify the minimum version of PHP that they support, so you can safely modernise your development practices without risking breaking your users&#8217; sites. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">#40934</a>)</li><li>We&#8217;ve added the <code>sodium_compat</code> library, which provides backwards compatibility for the <a href=\"https://blog.zend.com/2018/11/06/modern-cryptography-in-php-7-2-with-sodium/\">Sodium-based cryptography library added in PHP 7.2</a>. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45806\">#45806</a>)</li><li>There&#8217;s a new release of Dashicons, the WordPress Dashboard icon font. There are 25 new icons for you to use! (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41074\">#41074</a>)</li><li>You can now pass a label to <code>get_search_form()</code>, improving accessibility. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42057\">#42057</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.2&group=resolution&order=priority\">130 tickets closed</a> in WordPress 5.2 so far, with numerous small bug fixes and improvements to help smooth your WordPress experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for developer notes (which are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-2+dev-notes/\">assigned</a> the <code>dev-notes</code> tag) in the coming weeks detailing other changes in 5.2 that you should be aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

It performs an automated code review on pull requests using <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PHPCS</a>. This Action is based on WordPress.com VIP&#8217;s GPL-licensed <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-ci\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">review scripts</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/automated-phpcs-code-review.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Our action is a wrapper around the original <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-ci\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vip-go-ci</a> project,&#8221; rtCamp CEO Rahul Bansal said. &#8220;VIP’s project uses Teamcity which is expensive and very hard to get up and running. We built a wrapper around it to get it working with Github. Still huge props to them for sharing what we consider to be the USP of the VIP platform to the public at large.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deploy WordPress GitHub action</a> uses the <a href=\"https://deployer.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deployer.org</a> tool to deploy code changes. Using it requires your git repo to match rtCamp&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/wordpress-skeleton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Skeleton</a> which is very similar to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-skeleton\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VIP Go Skeleton</a>. The action includes optional support for <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hashicorp Vault</a>, which is useful for managing multiple servers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our action supports secrets fetching via HashiCorp Vault project,&#8221; Bansal said. &#8220;For small teams or indies using Vault might be overkill. But at scale, such as our hosting dept, where they are responsible for more than 100+ servers, <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress#hashicorp-vault-optional\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vault streamlines WordPress Deploys</a>. It’s partly because of Vault, devs can simply change the hostname on the fly and everything still works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>rtCamp has also released a GitHub action called <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/action-slack-notify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Notify</a> that sends a message to a Slack channel. It can be customized to notify a channel about deployment status. The Site and SSH Host details are available if the action is run following the <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/action-deploy-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deploy WordPress GitHub action</a>. All three of the new Actions are designed to work seamlessly together.</p>\n<p>rtCamp plans to add more Actions to its <a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/github-actions-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Actions Library</a> in the future. Bansal said they are currently working on build actions to cover Sass, Webpack, and Grunt, as well as Testing actions for phpunit and QUnit. Further down the road they are planning to build an action that will automatically update their theme and plugin products in their EDD store when there is a GitHub release.

Bulk scheduling comes in handy when you have several articles waiting to be published. </p>\n<p>In this article, we will show you how to easily bulk schedule posts in WordPress. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Bulk Schedule Posts in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulkschedulepostsinwp.png\" alt=\"Bulk Schedule Posts in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"340\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61944\" /></p>\n<h4>When Do You Need to Bulk Schedule WordPress Posts?</h4>\n<p>If you are the single author creating and managing content on your blog, then you can easily <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/schedule-your-posts-in-wordpress/\">schedule your blog posts</a> by using the default post scheduling feature in WordPress. </p>\n<p>But if you need to edit and schedule a lot of posts from several authors, then it can get a bit time-consuming. </p>\n<p>The native WordPress scheduling feature requires you to open each post individually to schedule and then save.</p>\n<p>Whereas a bulk schedule option can you let schedule multiple posts at once which will save you time that you can spend on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-increase-your-blog-traffic/\" title=\"How to Increase Your Blog Traffic – The Easy Way (27 Proven Tips)\">increasing traffic</a> and growing your blog.  </p>\n<p>With that said, let’s take a look at how to easily bulk schedule posts in WordPress step by step. </p>\n<h4>Bulk Scheduling WordPress Posts (Step by Step Guide)</h4>\n<p>First thing you need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-post-scheduler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Auto Post Scheduler</a> plugin. For detailed instructions, see our guide on how to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\">install a WordPress plugin easily</a>. </p>\n<p>Upon activation, you need to visit <strong>Settings &raquo; Auto Post Scheduler</strong> page to set up automatic bulk scheduling.  </p>\n<p><img title=\"Auto Post Scheduler Settings in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/autopostschedulersettings.png\" alt=\"Auto Post Scheduler Settings in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61948\" /></p>\n<p>On the top, you will see the Auto Post Scheduler’s status which is disabled by default and an ‘Enable Auto Post Scheduler’ button. You can enable auto scheduling by clicking on the button, but it will enable the default plugin settings. </p>\n<p>This is why we recommend reviewing and updating the plugin options before enabling the scheduler. </p>\n<p>First, you need to set the auto post interval time. By default, it is set to 24 hours which means that your drafts will be automatically published in the time interval of 24 hours. </p>\n<p>You can leave it unchanged if you want to publish one article each day. If you wish to publish two articles, you can set it to 12 hours. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Auto Post Scheduler Time Interval\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/autopostschedulertimeinterval.png\" alt=\"Auto Post Scheduler Time Interval Option\" width=\"550\" height=\"110\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61949\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you will see the ‘Restart on Publish’ option. You can check this option if you want the plugin to republish your already published posts. This setting basically allows you to recycle your old content and make your blog look fresh.</p>\n<p>After that, the ‘Start Scheduling Delay’ option lets you set a time delay before the first scheduled post goes live. It is set 0 seconds by default which means that your first scheduled post will be immediately published after the Scheduler is enabled. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Auto Post Scheduler Post Delay Option\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/autopostschedulerpostdelay.png\" alt=\"Auto Post Scheduler Post Delay Option\" width=\"550\" height=\"68\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61950\" /></p>\n<p>Next, ‘Limit check to these Post Type(s)’ lets you choose which post types you want to schedule automatically. There is a ‘Post’ selected by default. If you want to enable auto scheduling for your pages as well, then you can add them to the selection by clicking on them with Shift key pressed on your keyboard. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Choose Post Types to Schedule\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chooseposttypestoschedule.png\" alt=\"Choose Post Types to Schedule \" width=\"550\" height=\"129\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61951\" /></p>\n<p>Similarly, you can also select which categories to include in auto scheduling. All categories are added by default. However, you may want to exclude the ‘Uncategorized’ category. To do so, you need to select the other categories by clicking on them with Shift key on your keyboard pressed. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Choose Categories to schedule your WordPress posts\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/choosecategoriestoschedule.png\" alt=\"Choose Categories to schedule your WordPress posts\" width=\"550\" height=\"130\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61952\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you will see ‘Limit check to posts from these Authors’ option. You can include all or exclude any of them by selecting the ones you want to include. All authors are included by default. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Choose Authors to Schedule Posts in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chooseauthorstoscheduleposts.png\" alt=\"Choose Authors to Schedule Posts in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61953\" /></p>\n<p>You can also limit check to posts with the keyword search. If you want to exclude posts containing specific keywords, you can prepend the keywords with a hyphen and enter in the field. </p>\n<p>Another useful feature is ‘Limit checks on certain Day(s) to’ which lets you set in which hours the posts can be published. You will need to enter time range in 24-hour format. </p>\n<p>For example, if you want to publish your posts within 9 AM to 9 PM on Mondays, you need to enter 0900-2100 in the field for Mondays. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Limit check on certain days to schedule posts\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/limitcheckoncertaindaystoscheduleposts.png\" alt=\"Limit check on certain days to schedule posts\" width=\"550\" height=\"170\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61954\" /></p>\n<p>If these fields are left blank, all times of the day will be used. </p>\n<p>After that, you can choose on which days you don’t want to schedule posts. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Select Eligible Posts to Schedule\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/select-eligible-posts-toschedule.png\" alt=\"Select Eligible Posts to Schedule\" width=\"550\" height=\"133\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61955\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you can choose the eligible post statuses. You can select posts with Draft status, Pending status or Published. </p>\n<p>Below that, there are more settings you can use to recycle or republish your old posts. They are useful if you want to update your old posts with a new published date. </p>\n<p>Once you review all the settings, click the ‘Update options’ button at the bottom. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Update Auto Post Scheduler Options\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/updateautopostscheduleroptions.png\" alt=\"Update Auto Post Scheduler Options\" width=\"550\" height=\"133\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61957\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have updated your scheduling options, you can go to the top and click the ‘Enable Auto Post Scheduler’ button. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Enable Auto Post Scheduler in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/enableautopostschedulerinwp.png\" alt=\"Enable Auto Post Scheduler in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"188\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61958\" /></p>\n<p>That’s all! The plugin will automatically schedule all your eligible posts for future. You don’t need to open the posts manually to schedule. </p>\n<p>However, the automatic scheduling can sometimes slow down high traffic websites because it uses the <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-view-and-control-wordpress-cron-jobs/\">WordPress WP-Cron</a> for scheduling. You can solve that by setting Cron checks on a schedule or by using a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/best-wordpress-caching-plugins/\">WordPress caching plugin</a>. </p>\n<p>We hope this article helped you to learn how to schedule WordPress posts in bulk.

WordPress allows you to quickly resize images without using an image editing software. </p>\n<p>In this article, we will show you how to use WordPress as a basic image editor that lets you crop, rotate, scale, and flip images.</p>\n<p><img title=\"How to do basic image editing in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-editing-wp.png\" alt=\"How to do basic image editing in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"340\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62359\" /></p>\n<h4>Editing Images in WordPress Admin Area</h4>\n<p>First thing you need to do is upload your image in WordPress. You can <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-add-and-align-images-in-wordpress-block-editor/\" title=\"How to Add and Align Images in WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg)\">upload an image via post editor</a> while writing a post, or by visiting <strong>Media &raquo; Add New</strong> page. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Uploading an image via media uploader in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/uploadimage.png\" alt=\"Uploading an image via media uploader in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"272\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62308\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have uploaded an image, you need to visit <strong>Media &raquo; Library</strong> page. Now locate the image you just uploaded and click on it. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Select an image to edit in WordPress media library\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpmedialibrary.jpg\" alt=\"Select an image to edit in WordPress media library\" width=\"550\" height=\"305\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62309\" /></p>\n<p>This will open the image in a popup window. You will see image details in the right column and image preview on the left. </p>\n<p>Now there are two ways to open the image with the built-in WordPress image editor. </p>\n<p>The first option is to click on the &#8216;Edit image&#8217; button below the image preview which will open the image editor inside the popup. The second option is to click on the &#8216;Edit Image Details&#8217; link</p>\n<p><img title=\"Image editing options\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/editingoptions.jpg\" alt=\"Image editing options\" width=\"550\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62311\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking on the edit image details link will close the media popup and take you to the Edit Media page. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Edit media page\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/editmediapage.jpg\" alt=\"Edit media page\" width=\"550\" height=\"385\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62312\" /></p>\n<p>From here you can click on the &#8216;Edit Image&#8217; button below the image preview. This will open the image editing screen. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Edit image screen\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/editimagepage.jpg\" alt=\"Edit image screen\" width=\"550\" height=\"452\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62313\" /></p>\n<p>You will see a toolbar with some buttons on top of your image. On the right column, you will see a bunch of options to resize the image. </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what each of these options does and how to use them to edit your image in WordPress. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Image toolbar buttons\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image-toolbar-buttons.jpg\" alt=\"Image toolbar buttons\" width=\"550\" height=\"480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62314\" /></p>\n<p><strong>1. Crop</strong> &#8211; It allows you to crop images simply click the button and then select the image area you want to crop out of the original image. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Rotate</strong> &#8211; The two rotate buttons allow you to rotate an image clock-wise and counter-clock-wise. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Flip</strong> &#8211; The flip buttons allow you to flip an image horizontally or vertically. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Undo / Redo</strong> &#8211; If you don&#8217;t like a change you made, then simply undo your changes or redo them to revert back. </p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the options you have in the right column of the image edit screen. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Image edit settings\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/imagescalesettings-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image edit settings\" width=\"550\" height=\"432\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62316\" /></p>\n<p><strong>1. Scale Image</strong> &#8211; You can use this option to manually scale image keeping the original proportions. Use this option before cropping an image otherwise you may not be able to keep the image proportions. </p>\n<p>Note: You can only scale down an image in WordPress. You cannot <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-resize-and-make-images-larger-without-losing-quality/\" title=\"How to Resize and Make Images Larger without Losing Quality\">make images larger</a> by increasing the image dimensions. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Aspect ratio</strong> &#8211; If you want to keep a certain aspect ratio intact then this option allows you to set it. After that, you can click on the crop button to select an area while using the ratio you defined. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Thumbnail settings</strong> &#8211; From here you can choose whether you want to apply these changes to all image sizes, just the thumbnail, or all image sizes except thumbnail. Keep in mind that this thumbnail is the smallest <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-additional-image-sizes-in-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Create Additional Image Sizes in WordPress\">image size created by WordPress</a> for this image. It is not the same as the featured image or post thumbnail. </p>\n<p>Once you are satisfied with the changes you have made, don&#8217;t forget to click on the Save, Scale, or Update button to save your changes. </p>\n<p>WordPress will apply your changes to the image and create a new copy of the image on your server. </p>\n<h4>How to Restore Original Image After Editing</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not happy with the edited image, then you can easily revert back to the original version. Simply edit the image again, and this time you will notice a new meta box labeled &#8216;Restore original image&#8217;. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Restore image after editing it in WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/restoreimage.jpg\" alt=\"Restore image after editing it in WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"298\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62317\" /></p>\n<p>Click to expand it and then click on the &#8216;Restore image&#8217; button. WordPress will now restore your original image, and you will be able to edit it again or leave it as is. </p>\n<p>We hope this article helped you learn how to do basic image editing in the WordPress admin area.

Staging sites help you catch errors, so you don&#8217;t end up breaking your live website.</p>\n<p>A lot of users install WordPress locally on their <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-on-your-windows-computer-using-wamp/\" title=\"How to Install WordPress on Your Windows Computer Using WAMPServer\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-locally-on-mac-using-mamp/\" title=\"How to Install WordPress Locally on Mac Using MAMP\">Mac</a> computers to test changes. Once they&#8217;re done with the updates, they simply upload those changes from <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-from-local-server-to-live-site/\" title=\"How to Move WordPress From Local Server to Live Site (2 Methods)\">localhost to live server</a></p>\n<p>The biggest problem with this approach is what if something that worked on your localhost does not work on the live server? </p>\n<p>Often localhost and live WordPress hosting servers are not running the same environment.</p>\n<p>Since the staging site lives on your web hosting server, you can easily prevent all those errors because it runs the same server configuration as your live site.</p>\n<p>With that said, let&#8217;s take a look at how to setup a staging site for WordPress.</p>\n<h4>How to Easily Create a WordPress Staging Site</h4>\n<p>There are multiple ways to create a staging site for WordPress.

This is why it may not always give the best results. </p>\n<p>Secondly, the plugin we will be using will store your staging site on their own servers. If you are concerned about privacy and data protection, then this may not be the ideal situation for you. </p>\n<p>That being said, let&#8217;s see how to create a staging WordPress site using a WordPress plugin. </p>\n<p>The first thing that you need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wp-stagecoach/\" title=\"WP Stagecoach\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WP Stagecoach</a> plugin. For more details, see our step by step guide on <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" title=\"Step by Step Guide to Install a WordPress Plugin for Beginners\">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon activation, the plugin will add a new menu item labeled WP Stagecoach to your admin bar. Clicking on it will take you to plugin&#8217;s settings page. </p>\n<p><img title=\"WP Stagecoach settings\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpstagecoach-settings.png\" alt=\"WP Stagecoach settings\" width=\"550\" height=\"317\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62835\" /></p>\n<p>You will need to enter your WP Stagecoach username and the API key which you can find under your account on the plugin website.</p>\n<p>After that, you will be able to create your staging website. </p>\n<p>You need to provide a name for your staging site. This name will also be used as the subdomain of your WordPress staging website. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check the box next to &#8216;Password protect the staging site&#8217; option. It will protect your staging website from public view and search engines. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Create staging site using WP Stagecoach\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/createstagingsite-wps.png\" alt=\"Create staging site using WP Stagecoach\" width=\"550\" height=\"291\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62836\" /></p>\n<p>Next, click on the &#8216;Ride The Stagecoach&#8217; button to continue. </p>\n<p>The plugin will now create a backup of your WordPress files and database to export them for your staging site. Once finished, you will see the link to your staging site, and its admin area. </p>\n<p>You can click the link to visit your staging site and start working on it. </p>\n<p><strong>Deploying Staging Site to Live Using WP Stagecoach</strong> </p>\n<p>Once you are ready to import changes to your live site, head over to <strong>WP Stagecoach &raquo; Import Changes</strong> page and click on the check for changes button. </p>\n<p>The plugin will now check for changes on your staging site and then show you options to import them. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Impoting changes from staging\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/importallchanges.png\" alt=\"Impoting changes from staging\" width=\"550\" height=\"246\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62857\" /></p>\n<p>You can select to import only file changes, only database changes, or all changes. Next, click on the import button to continue. </p>\n<p>The plugin will show you the progress of the import and will notify you when it is done. You can now test your live site to see if all changes were successfully imported. </p>\n<h4 id=\"stagingmanually\">Create a Staging Site for WordPress Manually</h4>\n<p>This method requires you to manually create a staging site for your WordPress install. It is for advanced users and requires more work than other methods described above. </p>\n<p>Another disadvantage of this method is that your website will be temporarily unavailable when deploying changes back from staging to live server. </p>\n<p>That being said, let&#8217;s see how to manually create a staging environment for your WordPress site. </p>\n<p>First, you need to create a subdomain for your staging website. Go to your hosting account&#8217;s dashboard and click on the Subdomains link located under the domains section. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Create subdomain for your staging site\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/createsubdomain.png\" alt=\"Create subdomain for your staging site\" width=\"550\" height=\"352\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62858\" /></p>\n<p>Note: We&#8217;re using <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/hosting/bluehost/\" title=\"Bluehost\">Bluehost</a> in our example screenshot, so your screen may look different. </p>\n<p>Provide a name for your subdomain (for example, staging) and then click on the create button. </p>\n<p>Your hosting control panel will now add your subdomain, which you can use to import your live WordPress site. </p>\n<p>Next, you need to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/\" title=\"Duplicator\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Duplicator</a> plugin on your live site. </p>\n<p>Upon activation, you need to click on the Duplicator menu in your WordPress admin sidebar and click on the create new button. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Create Duplicator package\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/newduplicatorpackage.png\" alt=\"Create Duplicator package\" width=\"550\" height=\"312\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62859\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you will be asked to click on the Next button to continue.</p>\n<p>Duplicator will now run the website duplicator wizard. First, it will run some tests to see if everything is in order. If all items are marked ‘Good’, then click on the ‘Build’ button.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Build package\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buildpackage-2.png\" alt=\"Build package\" width=\"550\" height=\"345\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62860\" /></p>\n<p>The plugin will now start creating a duplicator package of your WordPress site. This process may take a few minutes depending on the size of your website.</p>\n<p>Once finished, you’ll see download options for Installer and the Archive package. You need to click on the ‘One click download’ link to download both files on your computer.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Download and package and installer files\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/downloadpackage-2.png\" alt=\"Download and package and installer files\" width=\"550\" height=\"284\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62861\" /></p>\n<p>Your new staging WordPress site will need a new database. Let&#8217;s create one. </p>\n<p>Head over to your WordPress hosting account&#8217;s control panel and click on MySQL Databases icon located under the Databases section. </p>\n<p><img title=\"MySQL Database\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mysqldb.png\" alt=\"MySQL Database\" width=\"550\" height=\"244\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62862\" /></p>\n<p>On the next screen, provide a name for your database and then click on the create database button. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Create database\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/createdb.png\" alt=\"Create database\" width=\"550\" height=\"278\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62865\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you need to create a MySQL user for your database. Scroll down to the MySQL Users section and provide a username and password for your new database user. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Create MySQL user\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mysqlusers.png\" alt=\"Create MySQL user\" width=\"550\" height=\"277\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62866\" /></p>\n<p>Now you need to give this user permissions to access and modify the database you created earlier. Simply scroll down to the &#8216;Add user to database&#8217; section and select your database and the user you just created. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Add user to database\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/addusertodb.png\" alt=\"Add user to database\" width=\"550\" height=\"231\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62878\" /></p>\n<p>After that, click on the &#8216;Add&#8217; button to continue. </p>\n<p>You will be asked to select privileges for the user. Go ahead and select &#8216;All Privileges&#8217; checkbox and then click on the &#8216;Make changes&#8217; button. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Grant privileges\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allprivileges.png\" alt=\"Grant privileges\" width=\"550\" height=\"231\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62879\" /></p>\n<p>Now your database is ready to be used for your staging website. </p>\n<p>Next, you need to open a new browser tab and visit enter the subdomain of your staging site like this: </p>\n<p>https://yoursubdomain.example.com/installer.php </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to replace yoursubdomain with the actual subdomain and example.com with your own domain name. </p>\n<p>This will launch the Duplicator installer wizard. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Duplicator installer wizard\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dup-1.png\" alt=\"Duplicator installer wizard\" width=\"550\" height=\"332\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62880\" /></p>\n<p>The installer will look for the archive file. You need to check the terms and conditions checkbox and click on the next button to continue.</p>\n<p>Now, the installer will ask you to enter your WordPress database information.</p>\n<p>Your host will likely be localhost. After that, you will enter the details of the database you created for your new domain name in the earlier step.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Connect database\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/connectdb-2.png\" alt=\"Connect database\" width=\"550\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62881\" /></p>\n<p>Once done, click on the next button to continue.</p>\n<p>Duplicator will now unpack your WordPress database backup from the archive into your new database.</p>\n<p>Next, it will ask you to update the site URL or Path. You shouldn’t have to change anything since it automatically detects the URL of your new subdomain and its path.</p>\n<p>If it doesn’t, then you can change the URL to your new subdomain. After that, click on the next button to continue. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Update URLs if needed\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/duplicator-url.png\" alt=\"Update URLs if needed\" width=\"550\" height=\"244\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62883\" /></p>\n<p>Duplicator will now finish the migration.</p>\n<p>You can click on the ‘Admin Login’ button to enter the WordPress admin area of your website on the new staging site.</p>\n<p>Now you have your staging site set up. Let&#8217;s protect it by adding password protection to your subdomain. </p>\n<p>Head over to your hosting account&#8217;s cPanel dashboard and click on the directory privacy icon. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Directory privacy\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/directory-privacy.png\" alt=\"Directory privacy\" width=\"550\" height=\"231\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62884\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you need to select your subdomain folder and then select the option to &#8216;password protect this directory&#8217; checkbox. You will be asked to provide a name for this setting, and then enter a username and password. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Password protect your staging site\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/protectdomain.png\" alt=\"Password protect your staging site\" width=\"550\" height=\"310\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62885\" /></p>\n<p>Click on the save button to store your settings. Your staging site will now be hidden behind the password protection. </p>\n<p>You can now work on your staging site and make any changes you want. </p>\n<p><strong>Manually Deploy Staging Site to Live</strong> </p>\n<p>After you are ready to deploy changes from your staging site to the live server, you will follow the same steps described above. </p>\n<p>Simply create a new Duplicator package on your staging site and download the Installer and Archive files to your computer. </p>\n<p>Next, you need to head over to your live site and create a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/7-best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared-pros-and-cons/\" title=\"7 Best WordPress Backup Plugins Compared (Pros and Cons)\">complete WordPress backup</a> (you can use Duplicator to create a complete backup as well). </p>\n<p>Once you are done, you will need to delete all WordPress files and folders from your live website. This means your WordPress site will be down for a while. </p>\n<p>Finally, follow the instructions above to run the Duplicator installer wizard to import staging site to live server.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the last method is not the best method at all. You should avoid this at all costs. We recommend using a reliable hosting provider like <a title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" >Bluehost</a>, <a title=\"SiteGround\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/siteground/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" >SiteGround</a>, or <a title=\"WPEngine\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/wpengine/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" >WP Engine</a> that offers built-in staging site features.</p>\n<p>We hope this article helped you learn how to easily create a staging environment for your WordPress site.

It&#8217;s the best drag and drop form builder plugin that allows you to create different types of forms without any hassle.</p>\n<p>You can follow the guide on <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to install a WordPress plugin</a> if you need any help.</p>\n<p>Now, you can always use <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-contact-form-in-wordpress/\">a simple contact form</a> for this tutorial. However, let&#8217;s create a gaming tournament registration form assuming that you&#8217;re planning to host a gaming tournament.</p>\n<p>And for that, you need to install the <strong>Form Templates Pack</strong> addon.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446972\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-form-templates-pack-addon.png\" alt=\"install Form Templates Pack addon\" width=\"562\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-form-templates-pack-addon.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/install-form-templates-pack-addon-300x115.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Form Templates Pack addon comes with more than 100 pre-built form templates for almost every niche. To install this addon, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Addons </strong>and click on the <strong>Install Addon</strong> button once you find it.</p>\n<p>Now go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Add New</strong> to create a new form. Search for the gaming tournament form in the <strong>Additional Templates</strong> section and click on it to use the template.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446977\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/additional-templates.png\" alt=\"additional templates\" width=\"562\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/additional-templates.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/additional-templates-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>With WPForms, you can customize your form easily and that too without any coding skills.

This will be required in the later stage of this tutorial.</p>\n<p>To create a new entry, you can embed your form to any post, page, or even the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-contact-form-in-wordpress-sidebar-widget/\">sidebar of your website</a>.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s use the preview option and create one test entry. So go to <strong>WPForms » All Forms</strong>, hover the mouse cursor over the title of your form and click on the <strong>Preview</strong> option.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446993\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/preview-form.png\" alt=\"preview form\" width=\"562\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/preview-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/preview-form-300x217.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Once your form opens in a new page, fill in the form and click on the <strong>Submit</strong> button to create a new entry for testing purpose.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s move to the next step now.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Install Zapier Addon</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be using <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/zapier-addon/\">Zapier addon</a> to connect our WordPress form to Discord. So go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Addons</strong> and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/install-activate-wpforms-addons/\">install the Zapier addon</a>.</p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Zapier allows you to integrate your form to over 1300 apps and do various tasks easily.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447009\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/zapier-addon.png\" alt=\"zapier addon\" width=\"562\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/zapier-addon.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/zapier-addon-300x120.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Settings</strong> and click on the <strong>Integration</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>Here you&#8217;ll see the Zapier API key for your site. You&#8217;ll need this API key to connect your WPForms site to Zapier. So keep this page open and proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447225\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-zapier-integration-api-key.png\" alt=\"WPForms Zapier integration api key\" width=\"562\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-zapier-integration-api-key.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-zapier-integration-api-key-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Create a New Zap</h3>\n<p>Zapier allows you to connect two or more apps to do automated tasks. This process is called Zap. It requires a trigger to do a particular action.</p>\n<p>In our case, the trigger is when someone submits the form and the action is a message will be posted in the Discord channel of your choice.</p>\n<p>To create a new Zap, go to the Zapier website and log in to your account. If you don&#8217;t have a Zapier account, you can <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">create a new account</a> for free.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447027\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/make-a-zap.png\" alt=\"make a zap\" width=\"562\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/make-a-zap.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/make-a-zap-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now click on the <strong>Make a Zap!</strong> button present in the top-right corner of your screen. This will open up a new page where we&#8217;ll be selecting WPForms as our trigger app.</p>\n<p>You can use the <strong>Choose a Trigger App</strong> search box to find WPForms. Once you find it, click on it to go to the next step.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447033\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-a-trigger-app.png\" alt=\"choose a trigger app\" width=\"562\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-a-trigger-app.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-a-trigger-app-300x77.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>WPForms offers just one trigger option. So select the trigger option <strong>New Form Entry</strong> and click on <strong>Save + Continue</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447038\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-form-entry.png\" alt=\"new form entry\" width=\"562\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-form-entry.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-form-entry-300x138.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In the next step, you&#8217;ll have to connect your WPForms account to Zapier. To do that, click on the <strong>Connect an Account</strong> button.</p>\n<p>This will open up a popup window. Here you&#8217;ve to enter your full website URL and the Zapier API key. You can go back to step 3 to understand how to get your API key.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447044\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allow-access-to-zapier.png\" alt=\"allow access to Zapier\" width=\"562\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allow-access-to-zapier.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/allow-access-to-zapier-300x257.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Once done, click on <strong>Yes, Continue</strong> button to connect your website to Zapier.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ll be taken back to the configuration wizard where you&#8217;ll see your WPForms account. You can click on the <strong>Test</strong> button to check if your website is connected or not.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447061\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/test-connection.png\" alt=\"test connection\" width=\"562\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/test-connection.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/test-connection-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If you get a success message, then click on <strong>Save + Continue</strong> button to go to the next step.</p>\n<p>Zapier will now fetch all your website forms and ask you to select one from the dropdown box. Select the Gaming Tournament Registration form that you&#8217;ve created earlier and click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447063\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/select-form-from-dropdown.png\" alt=\"select form from dropdown\" width=\"562\" height=\"213\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/select-form-from-dropdown.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/select-form-from-dropdown-300x114.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, Zapier will show you all the entries of your gaming tournament form. Just select any one of the entries for testing purpose and then click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Choose Discord as an Action App</h3>\n<p>In the last step, you&#8217;ve successfully created your trigger app. It&#8217;s time to choose Discord as the action app.</p>\n<p>So search for <strong>Discord</strong> and click on it to continue.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447067\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-an-action-app.png\" alt=\"choose an action app\" width=\"562\" height=\"140\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-an-action-app.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-an-action-app-300x75.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In the next step, you&#8217;ll be asked to select a Discord action that you want to happen when your form is submitted.</p>\n<p>Since you want a message to be posted to your Discord channel, select <strong>Send Channel Message</strong> and click on the <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447070\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/select-discord-action.png\" alt=\"select Discord action\" width=\"562\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/select-discord-action.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/select-discord-action-300x186.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You need to connect your Discord server to Zapier now. To do this, click on <strong>Connect an Account</strong>.</p>\n<p>A popup window will open up asking you to select a Discord server from the dropdown menu. And then, you&#8217;ve to click on the <strong>Authorize</strong> button to give Zapier the permission to use your Discord account.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447079\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/authorize-discord-app.png\" alt=\"authorize discord app\" width=\"562\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/authorize-discord-app.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/authorize-discord-app-300x214.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>After this, you need to click on the Google reCaptcha box to prove that you&#8217;re not a robot. Once done, your Discord account will be added to Zapier.</p>\n<p>You can check the connection by clicking on the <strong>Test</strong> button. Once you get the success message, click on <strong>Save + Continue</strong> to proceed to the next step.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447146\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/test-discord-connection.png\" alt=\"test Discord connection\" width=\"562\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/test-discord-connection.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/test-discord-connection-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now, you&#8217;ll have to set up the Discord channel message template. Don&#8217;t worry! It&#8217;s very simple.</p>\n<p>First of all, select a Discord channel from the <strong>Channel</strong> dropdown box. This will be the channel where all the form entries will be posted automatically.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Message Text</strong> box allows you to decide what message you want to be posted on your channel when someone submits the contact form on your site.</p>\n<p>You can click on the <strong>Insert a Field</strong> icon to add the contact form fields to the text area. And you can also add custom text if you want.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447197\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/discord-channel-message-template.png\" alt=\"discord channel message template\" width=\"562\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/discord-channel-message-template.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/discord-channel-message-template-300x227.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Rest of the fields are optional. So scroll down to the bottom of the form and click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>\n<p>To test whether everything is working properly, you can click on <strong>Send Test to Discord</strong> button in the next step. You&#8217;ll receive a success message saying that your test message was sent to Discord. You can also confirm that by checking your Discord channel.</p>\n<p>Now click on <strong>Finish</strong> to complete the action setup process and go to the final step.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-447211\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-to-discord-zap.png\" alt=\"WPForms to Discord Zap\" width=\"562\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-to-discord-zap.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-to-discord-zap-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Lastly, give any name to your Zap and turn it to <strong>ON </strong>to make your WPForms to Discord zap start working.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;ve successfully connected your WPForms contact form to Discord. So whenever someone submits the form, a message will be sent to your Discord channel automatically.</p>\n<h3>Endnote</h3>\n<p>We hope this article helped you to understand how to connect your WordPress form to Discord.</p>\n<p>If you want to add events to Google Calendar from your WordPress form, please check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-send-wpforms-entries-to-google-calendar/\">how to send WPForms entries to Google Calendar</a>.</p>\n<p>Not using WPForms so far?

A lot of people use Mailchimp because it has a free version where you can build an email list with up to 2,000 subscribers.</p>\n<p>Like most email marketing platforms, Mailchimp can help you with landing pages, monitoring your email campaigns, and providing Facebook ad templates.</p>\n<p>In addition, it has detailed reports where you can view real-time stats and check out how well your emails are doing.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-448130\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mailchimp-reporting-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"mailchimp-reporting-dashboard\" width=\"562\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mailchimp-reporting-dashboard.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mailchimp-reporting-dashboard-300x151.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Also, Mailchimp has a cool feature where you can schedule your email delivery time.</p>\n<p>For instance, you can use this to send at the time of day that most people open emails. The same email can be sent at separate times to different subscribers based on their location.

It is. Drip is more than just an email marketing provider. The service is technically an eCommerce Customer Relationship Manager (ECRM).</p>\n<p>You might recognize the term CRM because of popular CRM tools like <a title=\"HubSpot\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/hubspot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HubSpot</a>, Salesforce, or Zoho.

As an ECRM, their software has a lot of really powerful features you won&#8217;t find in an email marketing software like Mailchimp.</p>\n<p>Just because the tools are more powerful doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not easy to use, either. In other words, it&#8217;s great for beginners. Plus, it has a sleek and modern interface.</p>\n<p>There are tons of great features that makes Drip a more powerful Mailchimp alternative like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive visual workflow builder for automation workflows</li>\n<li>Connects with Facebook Lead Ads and Custom Audiences</li>\n<li>10 built-in reports on your WordPress dashboard with easy export</li>\n<li>Sends texts</li>\n<li>A/B testing to find out when/how your users engage with your messages</li>\n<li>Split testing workflows</li>\n<li>Landing page integrations</li>\n<li>Advanced subscriber management</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Drip users are on a paid plan. They don&#8217;t have a free plan. The Basic option starts at $45/month for unlimited emails and up to 2,500 subscribers.</p>\n<p>In addition, there&#8217;s a 14-days trial available.</p>\n<p>So if you want a Mailchimp alternative that&#8217;s more powerful and has email automation, you should be using <a title=\"Drip\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/drip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Drip</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

As part of their filtering process, many email providers will check whether your email originates from the same domain noted in the From Email. For example, if your email claims to be sent from your Gmail address but is actually sent from your website&#8217;s server (rather than Gmail&#8217;s server), your email may be sent to spam or not be delivered at all.</p>\n<p>You can fix this by using SMTP instead of the PHP mail function. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the industry standard for sending emails reliably.</p>\n<h3>Why Use the WP Mail SMTP Plugin?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit of using the WP Mail SMTP plugin is that it lets you send WordPress emails securely using your Gmail or G Suite account without requiring to enable less secure apps in your account.</p>\n<p>In addition, unlike many other SMTP options, you won’t need to enter your Gmail username and password in your WordPress dashboard where other site users can see them. By using this method, you&#8217;ll help to <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ultimate Guide to WordPress Security\">keep your WordPress site secure</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how to set up WP Mail SMTP for sending WordPress emails.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Install the WP Mail SMTP Plugin</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WP Mail SMTP</a> plugin. For step-by-step instructions, you can check out <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\">WPBeginner&#8217;s guide on how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>After installing and activating WP Mail SMTP, go to <strong>Settings » WP Mail SMTP</strong> to open the plugin settings page. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-page-1.png\" alt=\"Open WP Mail SMTP settings page\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423553\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-page-1.png 450w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-page-1-300x206.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></p>\n<p>At the top of this page, you&#8217;ll see the <strong>From Email</strong> and <strong>From Name</strong>. You can ignore these settings, because Google will automatically force these values to match the email account used in the next step.</p>\n<p>To start the setup process, you&#8217;ll need to scroll to the <strong>Mailer</strong> field and select the <strong>Google</strong> option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-Google-mailer-option-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-1.png\" alt=\"Select Google mailer option in WP Mail SMTP\" width=\"562\" height=\"214\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423571\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-Google-mailer-option-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-1.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-Google-mailer-option-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-1-300x114.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Google&#8217;s API (used by the Google mailer) will not allow you to customize certain aspects of your emails, such as the Reply To email address. If this is an important option in your project, please consider using <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-fix-wordpress-contact-form-not-sending-email-with-smtp/\" title=\"How to Fix WordPress Contact Form Not Sending Email With SMTP\">an alternative mailer option</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You can skip the <strong>Return Path</strong> checkbox, as Google does not allow this setting to be altered.</p>\n<p>Next, you should see a new Gmail section appear. Here, you&#8217;ll see fields for <strong>Client Secret</strong> and <strong>Client ID</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-section-of-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png\" alt=\"Gmail section of WP Mail SMTP settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423589\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-section-of-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-section-of-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>To get the information for these fields, you&#8217;ll need to create a web application through your Google account. This doesn&#8217;t require any coding, and we&#8217;ll show you exactly what to do.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Create a Web Application</h3>\n<p>To create an application, you&#8217;ll first need to <a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail&#038;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sign into your Gmail account and access Gmail&#8217;s application registration</a>. Clicking that link should open this Google page in a new tab or window, and you&#8217;ll want to keep your site settings open (we&#8217;ll return to those later).</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve followed that link and logged into your Gmail account, you should see a form named &#8220;Register your application for Gmail API in Google API Console&#8221;. </p>\n<p>In the dropdown labeled <strong>Select a project where your application will be registered</strong>, leave the default option of <strong>Create a project</strong>. In some cases, you may also be asked to agree to terms of service.</p>\n<p>After filling out this form, go ahead and click the <strong>Continue</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-a-new-project-for-Google-application.jpg\" alt=\"Create a new project for Google application\" width=\"562\" height=\"323\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423633\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-a-new-project-for-Google-application.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-a-new-project-for-Google-application-300x172.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you should see a screen that says &#8220;The API is enabled&#8221;. To proceed to the setup page, click the <strong>Go to credentials</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-API-is-enabled.png\" alt=\"Gmail API is enabled\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423593\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-API-is-enabled.png 500w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gmail-API-is-enabled-300x123.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>In the next page, you’ll be prompted to determine the credentials you need. Here are the fields on this page and the options you&#8217;ll need to select:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Which API are you using?</strong> Gmail API</li>\n<li><strong>Where will you be calling the API from?</strong> Web server (e.g. node.js, Tomcat)</li>\n<li><strong>What data will you be accessing?</strong> User data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve made these selections, click the <strong>What credentials do I need?</strong> button to go to the next step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project.png\" alt=\"Add credentials to Gmail app project\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423600\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project.png 500w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-credentials-to-Gmail-app-project-292x300.png 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>After clicking this button, Google will show a popup asking you to set up a consent screen. Go ahead and click on the <strong>Set Up Consent Screen Option</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-OAuth-consent-screen.png\" alt=\"Open OAuth consent screen\" width=\"562\" height=\"279\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-422938\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-OAuth-consent-screen.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open-OAuth-consent-screen-300x149.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>This will open a new tab or window. Be sure to keep the original tab/window open, as we&#8217;ll return to it a little later.</p>\n<p>In the new tab/window, you&#8217;ll be asked for several details to prepare your consent screen. This is the permissions screen that will display to you later in the setup process (never seen by your users).</p>\n<p>If you have a G Suite account, you&#8217;ll first set <strong>Application type</strong> to <strong>Internal</strong>. You will not see this option if you&#8217;re using an @gmail.com email account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-internal-application-type.jpg\" alt=\"Select internal application type\" width=\"562\" height=\"381\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423628\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-internal-application-type.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Select-internal-application-type-300x203.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>For <strong>Application name,</strong> you can add the name of your website (or any other name that feels logical to you).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fill-in-app-details.png\" alt=\"Fill in app details\" width=\"562\" height=\"365\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-422941\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fill-in-app-details.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fill-in-app-details-300x195.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, you can skip down to <strong>Authorized domains</strong> and add the URL for your website. Be sure to not include <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> here.</p>\n<p>For <strong>Application Homepage link</strong>, <strong>Application Privacy Policy link</strong>, and <strong>Application Terms of Service link</strong>, you can again just add your website URL. You don&#8217;t need to have special privacy or terms pages in place for this app, as again this consent screen will only ever be seen by you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-authorized-domain-information-to-Google-consent.png\" alt=\"Add authorized domain information to Google consent\" width=\"588\" height=\"562\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423477\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-authorized-domain-information-to-Google-consent.png 588w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Add-authorized-domain-information-to-Google-consent-300x287.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re ready, click the <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of this screen.</p>\n<p>After saving your consent screen settings, Google will take you back to an API credentials screen. You can ignore this, and instead return to the first tab/window. </p>\n<p>For this step, you&#8217;ll be creating an OAuth client ID. OAuth, or Open Authorization, is what will provide permission for your website to use your Gmail account to authenticate emails.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>Name</strong> field, enter anything you like or leave the default name. This is only for reference within your Google account.</p>\n<p>For <strong>Authorized JavaScript origins</strong>, you&#8217;ll need to enter your site&#8217;s URL.</p>\n<p>Last, we need to fill out the <strong>Authorized redirect URIs</strong> field. To get the URI for your site, you&#8217;ll need to go back to the tab or window with your WordPress site. Still on the <strong>Settings &raquo; WP Mail SMTP</strong> page, you&#8217;ll need to look under the Gmail section for the field labeled <strong>Authorized redirect URI</strong>.</p>\n<p>The value in this field should be your site&#8217;s URL followed by some extra details. You&#8217;ll need to copy this value, which is easily done by clicking the button with the copy icon. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png\" alt=\"Use button to copy authorized redirect URI from WP Mail SMTP settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"134\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423641\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Use-button-to-copy-authorized-redirect-URI-from-WP-Mail-SMTP-settings-300x72.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>After copying the URI, return to the Google APIs page and paste it into the field under <strong>Authorized redirect URIs</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-OAuth-client-ID.png\" alt=\"Create OAuth client ID\" width=\"562\" height=\"633\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-423481\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-OAuth-client-ID.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Create-OAuth-client-ID-266x300.png 266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>When you finish filling out these details, you may see a <strong>Refresh</strong> button near the bottom of the page.

Here are some of the possible error messages and how to resolve them.</p>\n<p><strong>401. That’s an error.<br />\nError: invalid_client</strong><br />\nThis error appears when the Client ID isn&#8217;t able to be read properly. To fix, try copying the Client ID in again and check that there&#8217;s no whitespace or extra text.</p>\n<p><strong>400. That’s an error.<br />\nError: invalid_request<br />\nMissing required parameter: client_id</strong><br />\nThis error will display when the Client ID field is empty or not able to be read properly. To fix, copy in the Client ID again and be careful to not add extra text or whitespace.</p>\n<p><strong>cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem</strong><br />\nThis message means that the server is missing a certificate that’s required for SMTP to work. To fix, you&#8217;ll need to contact your site&#8217;s hosting provider to ask them to install this certificate (most likely the cacert.pem certificate, though it&#8217;s best to ask your host to check).</p>\n<p><strong>“code”: 401,<br />\n“message”: “Login Required”</strong><br />\nIf you see this in the debug message, permission still needs to be granted to your use Google account. For instructions on how to fix this, please see <a href=\"#step-3\" title=\"Step 3: Grant Permissions and Send Test Email\">Step 3</a> of this tutorial. Also, be sure to check that the From Email in your SMTP settings matches the email used to setup the Google app.</p>\n<h6 id=\"verified\">What If I See a Screen Saying &#8220;This app isn&#8217;t verified&#8221;?</h6>\n<p>When you click the <strong>Allow plugin to send emails using your Google account</strong> button, Google might display a screen that says &#8220;This app isn&#8217;t verified. This app hasn&#8217;t been verified by Google yet. Only proceed if you know and trust the developer.&#8221; There&#8217;s no need to worry, though &#8212; the message is only referring to the app that you just created in your own Google account (so you are actually the developer in this case).</p>\n<p>To bypass this message, you&#8217;ll need click <strong>Advanced</strong> and then <strong>Proceed</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/This-app-isnt-verified-error.png\" alt=\"This app isnt verified error\" width=\"562\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-456979\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/This-app-isnt-verified-error.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/This-app-isnt-verified-error-300x160.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h6>What If I Want to Switch to A Different Email Later?</h6>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to change to a different Gmail/G Suite email address, you&#8217;ll need to repeat all tutorial steps above. This includes generating a new Client ID and Client Secret under this other email account.</p>\n<p>When you get to the Authorization step (under Step 3), save your settings and then click the <strong>Remove Connection</strong> button. This will remove the authorization for your original email account and allow you to repeat the authorization steps with the new email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP.png\" alt=\"Remove connection in WP Mail SMTP\" width=\"703\" height=\"124\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-223847\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP.png 703w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Remove-connection-in-WP-Mail-SMTP-300x53.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px\" /></p>\n<p>That’s it!

Although WordPress forms may seem like basic necessities to your website, successful digital marketers know that forms are much more than a simple way for users to contact you.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not taking advantage of all that <a href=\"http://wpforms.com\">WPForms</a> has to offer yet, you could be missing out on a lot of income.</p>\n<p>So whether you&#8217;re looking to boost your revenue or simply get website visitors to return to your site, here&#8217;s a list of effective WPForms power hacks to help you grow your business online.</p>\n<h3>1. Use Conditional Logic to Ask the Right Questions</h3>\n<p>You can easily show or hide something to a website visitor on your forms once they select something that triggers this.</p>\n<p>With Smart Conditional Logic, you can customize forms by having fields automatically show or hide other fields depending on a user’s selection.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may want to invite someone to write a review only if they give you a high rating on a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/create-a-survey-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/\">survey form</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, set up an extra field to appear when someone selects &#8216;Other&#8217; in your form. In that case, you&#8217;d show another field.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-450814 size-full\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/conditional-logic-show-fields.gif\" alt=\"conditional-logic-show-fields-grow-your-online-business\" width=\"562\" height=\"322\" /></p>\n<p>On the other hand, it may be beneficial to hide fields. For example, maybe you only need one way to contact your users: an email address or a phone number. Once they start filling out their email address, you can set the phone field to be hidden automatically, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>You can even take it a step further with creating multiple conditions by using AND/OR logic.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s much easier than you may think. Check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-conditional-logic-with-wpforms/\">how to use conditional logic with WPForms.</a></p>\n<h3>2. Send Form Notifications to the Right People</h3>\n<p>With Conditional Notifications, you can send out different emails to different people / departments depending on what a user selects on your form.</p>\n<p>For example, if a user is submitting a complaint and selects that they had an issue with billing, you could have an email go out to a billing coordinator from your team.</p>\n<p>If the same users selects that their issue was with sales, you could direct that email to come to you or whoever manages sales for your small business.</p>\n<p>Head over to our step by step instructions on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-conditional-form-notifications-in-wpforms/\">how to create conditional form notification emails in WPForms</a> to learn more.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-450862\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/notification-conditional-logic.jpg\" alt=\"notification-conditional-logic\" width=\"562\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/notification-conditional-logic.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/notification-conditional-logic-300x91.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>All of this is completely customizable and helps streamline your business processes so you can get back to customers more quickly.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-450864\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/notification-info-conditional.jpg\" alt=\"notification-info-conditional\" width=\"562\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/notification-info-conditional.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/notification-info-conditional-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>So that way, you can keep visitors happy and turn them into loyal fans who spend money, send referrals, and help grow your business online.</p>\n<h3>3.

Smart Tags use curly brackets and look something like this:<code>{admin_email}</code>.</p>\n<p>Smart Tags are great hacks because they can save you time by allowing you to include useful details in your forms.</p>\n<p>The <code>{admin_email}</code><strong> </strong>is the default Smart Tag used in the <strong>Send To Email Address</strong> field in forms. And it automatically fills in the email address of the site administrator.</p>\n<p>And there are tons of other ways to customize your notifications with Smart Tags, making getting detailed form submissions so much easier.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-451462\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/enhanced-notifications-with-smart-tags.jpg\" alt=\"enhanced-notifications-with-smart-tags\" width=\"562\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/enhanced-notifications-with-smart-tags.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/enhanced-notifications-with-smart-tags-255x300.jpg 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Check out our instructions on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">how to use Smart Tags in WPForms</a> to get started with this power hack right now.</p>\n<h3>20. Use Smart Tags in Hidden Fields to Uncover Data</h3>\n<p>Another smart hack to use in your arsenal is adding a Smart Tag to a Hidden Field on your form.</p>\n<p>For instance, by adding the {url_referer} Smart Tag, your form will automatically insert the address of the page which referred the user to the page containing the form. This will help you learn where on your site your website visitors are coming from before they end up on your form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-451483\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hidden-field-smart-tags.jpg\" alt=\"hidden-field-smart-tags\" width=\"562\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hidden-field-smart-tags.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hidden-field-smart-tags-150x150.jpg 150w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hidden-field-smart-tags-300x298.jpg 300w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hidden-field-smart-tags-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>For instance, if a user went from your home page to your contact page, and then filled out your form there, this Smart Tag would give you the URL of your home page.</p>\n<p>And you can also do this with IP addresses, geolocation, and more. This hack can help you learn a lot about your leads and help you convert them into paying customers. That way, you can grow your business online fast.</p>\n<p>Check out our step by step instructions on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/#url\">how to use smart tags in hidden fields in WPForms</a>.</p>\n<h3>21.

Then, must copy/paste the code for the form into your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>And, if you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> using WordPress, you can <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/how-to-install-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">learn how to easily setup a WordPress site here</a>.</p>\n<p>Typeform is somewhat beginner-friendly.</p>\n<p>Above all, it focuses on making slick-looking surveys that are fun and conversational for your audience. With Typeform, you can focus on gathering data by asking your customers questions in a very modern way.</p>\n<p>And besides surveys, you can also use Typeform to build things like contact forms, quizzes, shopping carts, and feedback forms. Their form builder lets you chose from some good-looking templates to help you start creating a form quickly.</p>\n<p>However, Typeform lacks a lot of the features that WPForms offers. Let&#8217;s take a deeper look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ease\">Ease of Use</h3>\n<p>Creating a form on your website should be easy. So, the process needs to be beginner-friendly. And you shouldn&#8217;t have to use any code. Let&#8217;s take a peek at how WPForms vs Typeform match up with ease of use.</p>\n<p><strong>WPForms</strong></p>\n<p>Beginners love WPForms for good reason. One reason is because it&#8217;s super user-friendly. You can easily make forms in minutes by using a drag and drop builder, right in WordPress. Even gorgeous Conversational Forms are simple to create with WPForms.</p>\n<p>One of the places where WPForms really shines is with how simple it is to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-simple-contact-form-in-wordpress/\">add your form to your WordPress website</a>.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to use any code because the WPForms plugin handles this all for you. And you can choose to add your forms to pages, posts, sidebars, footers, or any other widget areas on your site.</p>\n<p>Using the WPForms <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-templates-pack-addon/\">Form Templates Pack Addon,</a> you get access to 100+ pre-built templates for a variety of needs. These templates are lifesavers because they save you tons of time building your forms.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436509\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-tempates.jpg\" alt=\"wpforms-tempates\" width=\"562\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-tempates.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-tempates-300x254.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>And you can easily add fields by dragging them from the left side to the right side. Likewise, deleting fields is as simple as 1 click.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436554\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/edit-wpforms-surveys.jpg\" alt=\"edit-wpforms-surveys\" width=\"562\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/edit-wpforms-surveys.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/edit-wpforms-surveys-300x191.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In addition, customizing your Conversational Forms is very simple with WPForms.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436546\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-survey-builder.jpg\" alt=\"wpforms-survey-builder\" width=\"562\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-survey-builder.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-survey-builder-150x150.jpg 150w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-survey-builder-300x300.jpg 300w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-survey-builder-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-block\" style=\"background-color: #e2772f !important; color: #fff !important; padding: 20px 25px !important; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 4px !important; -moz-border-radius: 4px !important; -webkit-border-radius: 4px !important; font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Click Here to See Conversational Forms in Action\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/conversational-forms-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click Here to See Conversational Forms in Action</a></p>\n<p><strong>Typeform</strong></p>\n<p>Using Typeform might be a little difficult for some beginners.</p>\n<p>So, although it&#8217;s fairly easy to create a pretty survey form with Typeform, inserting the form into your site can be hard.</p>\n<p>For instance, when you&#8217;re ready to add the form you&#8217;ve built to your website, you need to go to your site&#8217;s HTML text editor. Here, you&#8217;ll inset the HTML code for your Typeform form exactly where you want it to show up on your website. This can be a difficult task for beginners.</p>\n<p>The 60+ templates Typeform provides are designed for things like surveys, feedback, questionnaires, and more.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436503\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-template.jpg\" alt=\"typeform-template\" width=\"562\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-template.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-template-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Beginners might also feel a little intimated by the advanced way you customize your forms with Typeform.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436517\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-survey-builder.jpg\" alt=\"typeform-survey-builder\" width=\"562\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-survey-builder.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-survey-builder-300x217.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"conversationalforms\">Conversational Forms</h3>\n<p>Conversational forms are beautiful and interactive forms. They act as a conversation between you and your visitors. Both WPForms and Typeform offer Conversational Forms. Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>\n<p><strong>WPForms</strong></p>\n<p>Conversational forms are a great feature on top of tons of other options in WPForms. They look great and are so engaging.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-435433\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/interactive-conversational-forms-example.gif\" alt=\"interactive-conversational-forms-example\" width=\"562\" height=\"405\" /></p>\n<p>Most importantly, these interactive forms boost form completion and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-combat-order-form-abandonment-and-increase-your-sales/\">decrease form abandonment</a>.</p>\n<p>And WPForms lets you connect your Conversational Forms to all of the top email marketing services.</p>\n<p>So, although Typeform also has beautiful full-page Conversational Forms, WPForms adds a ton of unique features to their forms like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Signature Addon. </strong>Lets users sign your form electronically.</li>\n<li><strong>Geolocation Data. </strong>See where your users are on a map.</li>\n<li><strong>User Registration. </strong>Let users register for things like your forums, eCommerce, and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/best-wordpress-membership-plugins-compared/\">membership sites</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Captcha. </strong>Use custom or math questions to make sure your user is human.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Abandonment Addon. </strong>Get more leads by capturing partial entries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Typeform</strong></p>\n<p>Typeform focuses heavily on Conversational Forms. They have some hip looking templates that help you build these interactive forms.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436632\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-full-page-conversational-forms.jpg\" alt=\"typeform-full-page-conversational-forms\" width=\"562\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-full-page-conversational-forms.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-full-page-conversational-forms-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>It uses the logic jump feature to ask different questions based on someone&#8217;s answer to the last question.</p>\n<p>You can build surveys and questionnaires, quizzes, polls, and more. All as Conversational Forms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customersupport\">Customer Support</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s super important to have fast and helpful customer service when you have a question or need help with your forms.</p>\n<p>You should be able to access and successfully complete simple tasks by following easy and clear instructions in your form builder&#8217;s documentation hub. These docs need to be easily understood by everyone, even beginners.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s check out how WPForms vs Typeform compare in this area.</p>\n<p><strong>WPForms</strong></p>\n<p>The support at WPForms is excellent. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the best things about WPForms.</p>\n<p>For example, you can open your own support ticket, and the team usually responds to requests within 24 hours on weekdays. It doesn&#8217;t matter which level of plan you use have WPForms, because you get direct help from a real person even with the WPForms basic plan.</p>\n<p>Support staff is friendly, helpful, and they genuinely care about doing the right thing for their customers.</p>\n<p>You can also visit their <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/\">Documentation center</a> and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/blog/\">blog</a> for step by step tutorials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-436638 size-full\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-help-documentation.jpg\" alt=\"wpforms-help-documentation\" width=\"562\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-help-documentation.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wpforms-help-documentation-300x164.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Typeform</strong></p>\n<p>Typeform has a mix of different ways to get help.</p>\n<p>They have a blog and use a Help Center with documentation.</p>\n<p>However, getting support on Typeform is limited. The Basic free plan restricts you to just ten questions per form.</p>\n<p>So, you need to be on at least a Pro or Pro+ premium plan to get direct support from the customer success team.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-436656\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-help-docs.jpg\" alt=\"typeform-help-docs\" width=\"562\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-help-docs.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/typeform-help-docs-300x141.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"integrations\">Integrations</h3>\n<p>Your online form builder should also have lots of integrations to help you manage all kinds of forms.</p>\n<p>They should connect with tools like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal</li>\n<li>Stripe</li>\n<li>Zapier</li>\n<li><a title=\"Drip\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/drip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Drip</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Constant Contact\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/constant-contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Constant Contact</a></li>\n<li>And More</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, WPForms vs Typeform both have tons of integrations with fantastic tools including those listed above and others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\n<p>Not everyone can afford a ton of money on form builders. So, the one you buy should have an inclusive pricing plan. Meaning, all of their services and features are affordable to use for everyone.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s check out how the costs of WPForms and Typeform add up.</p>\n<p><strong>WPForms</strong></p>\n<p>WPForms has 4 different pricing plans: Basic, Plus, Pro, and Elite. These plans start at $39.50 to $299.50 per year.</p>\n<p>This pricing is great for small businesses and website owners looking for a simple tool with powerful features. As a result, you don&#8217;t have hire an expensive developer and can stay within your budget.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-435525\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-much-does-wpforms-cost.jpg\" alt=\"how-much-does-wpforms-cost\" width=\"562\" height=\"649\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-much-does-wpforms-cost.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-much-does-wpforms-cost-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>To access features like Conversational Forms and payment integration, you&#8217;ll want to pick the Pro plan. This is the most popular WPForms plan.</p>\n<p>Also, WPForms has a really great refund policy. If you buy a WPForms plan and change your mind for any reason in the next 14 days, they will refund 100% of your money.</p>\n<p><strong>Typeform</strong></p>\n<p>Typeform has 3 different pricing plans to pick from: Basic (free), Pro, and Pro+. Per year, Pro costs $360 and Pro+ costs $700.</p>\n<p>But, the pricing can be expensive for beginner website owners. Especially if you&#8217;re looking to create more than just Conversational Forms.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-435524\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-much-does-typeform-cost.jpg\" alt=\"how-much-does-typeform-cost\" width=\"562\" height=\"419\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-much-does-typeform-cost.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-much-does-typeform-cost-300x224.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>The Basic (free) plan has very little features and integrations.</p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s best for trial runs because it only allows you to collect 100 responses to your form. Also, it doesn&#8217;t let you use logic jump, upload files, or take payments.</p>\n<p>To get unlimited answers to your forms, you&#8217;ll need to go with The Pro and Pro+ plans with Typeform.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bottomline\">Bottom Line: WPForms vs Typeform</h3>\n<p>So, which is better?

They also provide free domain and professional email with their service.</p>\n<p>However, if you&#8217;ve got a high traffic website or you&#8217;re not confident with the technical aspects of running a WordPress site, then you should use managed WordPress hosting service.</p>\n<p>But with so many hosting providers out there, how to decide which managed hosting company is suitable for your needs?</p>\n<p>Here are the essential factors to look for before choosing a managed host:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast, reliable, and secure service.</li>\n<li>Daily backups of your website.</li>\n<li>Free SSL (<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/ssl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Secure Sockets Layer</a>) and CDN (<a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-cdn-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Content Delivery Network</a>).</li>\n<li>Expert customer support team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Best Managed WordPress Hosting in 2019</h3>\n<p>By now, you should have made up your mind that you need to buy or migrate to a managed WordPress hosting for your website.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s take a look at the best managed WordPress hosting in 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Our sister site <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WPBeginner</a> recently conducted speed tests on some of the hosting service providers listed here.

And the best part is they&#8217;re one of the officially recommended hosting providers by WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Though SiteGround is a popular shared hosting provider, they also offer powerful managed hosting service. They use the latest technologies to make sure your <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-pros-and-cons-compared/\">WordPress website</a> is fast and suffers zero downtime.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the features of SiteGround:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free SSL certificates by Let&#8217;s Encrypt.</li>\n<li>Create unlimited professional email accounts.</li>\n<li>Free Cloudflare CDN to make your site faster.</li>\n<li>One-click staging tool to create a copy of your website, do necessary changes to it, and then make it live.</li>\n<li>Free site migration service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like most hosting providers on our list, SiteGround takes daily backups to make sure your data is always safe. They keep up to 30 backup copies which can be restored quickly. You can even manually backup your site with a single click.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the speed test result of SiteGround:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-441011\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/speed-test-siteground.jpg\" alt=\"SiteGround Speed Test\" width=\"562\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/speed-test-siteground.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/speed-test-siteground-300x120.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You can purchase the basic or startup plan of SiteGround at $3.95 per month. However, you&#8217;ll be allowed to host just one website and free site migration is not included with this plan.</p>\n<p>We would instead recommend you to use the GrowBig plan which is priced at $5.95 per month to avail all the features.</p>\n<h3>3. <a title=\"Bluehost Optimized\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost-optimized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost Optimized</a></h3>\n<p><a title=\"Bluehost Optimized\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost-optimized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-439643\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bluehost-optimized-hosting-for-wordpress.png\" alt=\"Bluehost Optimized Hosting for WordPress\" width=\"562\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bluehost-optimized-hosting-for-wordpress.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bluehost-optimized-hosting-for-wordpress-300x139.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bluehost is a popular shared hosting service and just like SiteGround, it&#8217;s also recommended by WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>However, we&#8217;ll not be talking about their shared hosting service here; instead, we&#8217;ll take a look at their WordPress Optimized service called Bluehost Optimized.</p>\n<p>Before talking about the features of Bluehost Optimized, let&#8217;s take a look at the speed test results:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-441008\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bluehost-speed-test.jpg\" alt=\"Bluehost Speed Test\" width=\"562\" height=\"213\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bluehost-speed-test.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bluehost-speed-test-300x114.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Bluehost Optimized service uses VPS technologies and thus makes sure <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your site is secure</a> and extremely fast.</p>\n<p>They offer a free domain with all their plans.

This mailing list is used to send out emails.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can use your email list to send out new blog posts, business announcements, and to sell your products or services.</p>\n<h3>Should You Buy an Email List?</h3>\n<p>It may seem tempting, but buying an email list is never a good idea.</p>\n<p>People will probably mark your email as spam if they didn&#8217;t sign up for your list. Plus, it&#8217;s not always likely they&#8217;re interested in your products if they&#8217;ve never been to your website.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not only legal, but also ethical to <strong>only</strong> send emails to people who actually agreed to get emails from you.</p>\n<p>In the end, you rarely get what you pay for when you buy an email list.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Building an Email List</h3>\n<p>So, a lot of business owners and bloggers who are just starting out don&#8217;t realize how important an email list actually is.</p>\n<p>The power of email lists is in the numbers. According to the Direct Marketing Association, email marketing sees a 4300% average return on investment (ROI) for businesses in the US.</p>\n<p>To get started creating a simple form and email list right away, read our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-simple-contact-form-in-wordpress/\">how to create a simple contact form in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are some other strong reasons why building an email list is so important:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You&#8217;ll Easily Get Messages to Customers</li>\n<li>Get Visitors to Return</li>\n<li>Email Is Personal</li>\n<li>Huge Companies Love Email Lists</li>\n<li>You Own Your Email List</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll Make More Money</li>\n<li>Email Builds Trust</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look into each of these benefits of building an email list.</p>\n<p><strong>1. You&#8217;ll Easily Get Messages to Customers</strong></p>\n<p>According to Radicati Group, there are over 3.6 billion email users. That&#8217;s more than half of the planet. By 2022, that number will reach 4.2 billion!</p>\n<p>In addition, studies show at least 91% of consumers check their email at least once a day. You can go days without checking your social media. These numbers are part of why building an email list is a no-brainer for smart businesses.</p>\n<p>When you send an email, your words are delivered directly to someone&#8217;s inbox.</p>\n<p>However, due to the nature of social media, your customer is much more likely to miss your update in their feed.</p>\n<p>This shows why email lists are important and much more effective at getting your message in front of your customer than social media.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Get Visitors to Return</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a scary but true fact:</p>\n<p>More than 70% of people leaving your website <strong>never</strong> return. For proof, just take a look at your Google Analytics and check out the percentage of new vs returning visitors.</p>\n<p>And your visitors are valuable. Out of all the websites in the world, they&#8217;ve ended up on yours.</p>\n<p>What you don&#8217;t want is miss the chance to turn a casual web surfer into an avid fan who visits your site all the time.</p>\n<p>People are much more likely to come back to your website when they see an email in their inbox from you. Invite them back with another great post, a well-written announcement, or a special sale.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Email Is Personal</strong></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you feel more interested in an email that starts by using your name?</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-435355\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/personalized-email-list-example.jpg\" alt=\"personalized-email-list-example\" width=\"562\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/personalized-email-list-example.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/personalized-email-list-example-300x274.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Consumers love this.</p>\n<p>Personalization helps your email marketing go from average to great. Don&#8217;t lose revenue by ignoring personalization. Check out our sister site&#8217;s article with <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/ecommerce-personalization-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eCommerce personalization examples</a> to help lift your sales.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can personalize your messages to your email list with email marketing services like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/constant-contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Constant Contact</a> and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/drip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Drip</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition, email is very direct. Every person on your list gets an email the same way they get a piece of mail. It&#8217;s so different from seeing a message in a newsfeed as they scroll by.</p>\n<p>Also, just the act of receiving an email is personal. For example, people get emails from your business in the very same inbox they get emails from their parents.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Huge Companies Love Email Lists</strong></p>\n<p>Take a lesson from the digital marketing playbook of the biggest brands in the world. They spend tons of money on campaigns just to get people to sign up for their email list.</p>\n<p>For example, just think about the last website you visited to buy things like clothes, shoes or jewelry. Chances are, they asked for your email.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-434558\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-list-lead-magnet-example.jpg\" alt=\"email-list-lead-magnet-example\" width=\"562\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-list-lead-magnet-example.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-list-lead-magnet-example-300x145.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>These big brands are smart to use social media to build an email list on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others. They focus so much energy on building their email lists because they&#8217;ve seen amazing results.</p>\n<p>They know that email lists are super valuable and building an email list helps boost sales. Big name companies understand that email lists are fantastic long-term investments that have high returns for low costs.</p>\n<p>Even the social media companies themselves know how important it is to send messages to their email lists:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-434662\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/why-to-build-an-email-list.jpg\" alt=\"why-to-build-an-email-list\" width=\"562\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/why-to-build-an-email-list.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/why-to-build-an-email-list-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>5. You Own Your Email List</strong></p>\n<p>Except for your website, your email list is the only thing you have control over when it comes to your online business.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may have thousands of followers on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, but those followers actually belong to those companies.</p>\n<p>However, one of the biggest benefits of building an email list is that your list is <strong>all yours</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t control when a social media platform changes its policies. Those changes can influence your campaigns. Getting complete control over your subscriber list and focusing on building your email list is a smart business move.</p>\n<p><strong>6. You&#8217;ll Make More Money</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine that each one of your website visitors is a lead. Doesn&#8217;t it make sense to ask for their info so you can follow-up with them?</p>\n<p>You already know they&#8217;re interested in your niche since they&#8217;re on your site.</p>\n<p>Because of this, subscribers are much more likely to become buyers. Since these people joined your email list from your site, you know they&#8217;re already very interested in what you&#8217;re offering.</p>\n<p>Your subscribers put in the work to hear from you!</p>\n<p>Also, since the average ROI on email marketing is 4300%, it ends up being incredibly inexpensive.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Email Builds Trust</strong></p>\n<p>Sending emails to your customer builds trust between you and them.</p>\n<p>When people read an email from you, they do it in the privacy of their inbox. It&#8217;s not a message displayed publicly on a billboard or a social media timeline.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a more intimate way to communicate.</p>\n<p>Because email lists let customers feel like they&#8217;re part of a private conversation, they can ask you questions confidently by replying to your message. This helps build trust and a connection.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Grow My Email List?</h3>\n<p>There are tons of ways to grow your email list. Some of the most popular ways include:</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Magnets. </strong>A lead magnet is an incentive you offer your visitors in exchange for their email address. This could be a free PDF, an eBook, a report, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Giveaways</strong>. Ask for someone&#8217;s email address as an entry. You can give them extra entries when they share your giveaway on social media.</p>\n<p><strong>Create A Poll. </strong>Get your visitors engaged and ask for their email in the process. WPForms lets you easily create engaging content with our <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/introducing-the-new-wpforms-surveys-and-polls-addon/\">Surveys and Polls Addon.</a> To start setting up polls on your website, read our guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/good-poll-questions-to-ask-on-your-forms-for-better-feedback/\">good poll questions to ask on your forms for better feedback</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Offer a Coupon. </strong>An excellent option if you&#8217;re an eCommerce business.

It&#8217;s true that they cost money, but above all they&#8217;re an investment in your business with big returns.</p>\n<p>In addition, here are some of the downsides of using some free platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can&#8217;t target specific subscribers by interests or demographics.</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s no reporting so you can&#8217;t tell which percentage of subscribers opened your email and visited your site.</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s little email customization.</li>\n<li>If you try to move to a paid service, your users will have to re-confirm. Many won&#8217;t, so you&#8217;ll lose subscribers.</li>\n<li>You can&#8217;t run A/B split tests to see which subject line and offers work best for your users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, it&#8217;s just a smart move to use a professional email marketing service like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/constant-contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Constant Contact</a> or <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/drip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Drip</a> if you&#8217;re a small business or entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!

Plus, Checkbox fields are going to make it even easier to segment and convert visitors into paying customers.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new in WPForms 1.5.2.</p>\n<h3>Phone Fields Now Auto-Detect Country Codes</h3>\n<p>The Phone field in your forms just got a super helpful revamp.</p>\n<p>The new Smart Phone feature auto-detects your user&#8217;s region as the form is loading. The Phone field will now show which region the person filling out the form is currently located in.</p>\n<p>If a user starts to type in a phone number format that&#8217;s different from the auto-detected format, a message will appear.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443888\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/form-message-wrong-format.jpg\" alt=\"form-message-wrong-format\" width=\"562\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/form-message-wrong-format.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/form-message-wrong-format-300x161.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /><br />\nAnd, it&#8217;s really easy for the user to change the auto-detected region on the Phone field.</p>\n<p>For example, say someone from India is visiting the US. The form will auto-detect that they are in the US and add the US phone number format to the Phone field.</p>\n<p>But, let&#8217;s also say that the user wants to enter their phone number which is from India, not the US.</p>\n<p>To do this, they can simply select a different region from the dropdown menu inside the Phone field.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443880\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dropdown-region-select.jpg\" alt=\"dropdown-region-select\" width=\"562\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dropdown-region-select.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dropdown-region-select-300x161.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If your business gets form entries from multiple regions, you&#8217;ll especially love this Smart Phone feature. We also created this new feature so that international users can now get validation when entering their number, not just US users.</p>\n<p>The Smart Phone feature will help you manage your form entries and keep phone numbers consistent and accurate. And, you&#8217;ll end up with higher quality leads.</p>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-choose-the-right-form-field-for-your-forms/#phone\">how to choose the right form field for your forms</a> to learn more about the different phone formats.</p>\n<h3>Get More Leads With Email Address Typo Detection</h3>\n<p>The Email Field now has an exciting new feature you&#8217;ll love.</p>\n<p>The Smart Email feature spots typos in common domain names. The Email field will now display a message suggesting a fix if a user types in their email address wrong.</p>\n<p>For example, if someone types in liz@gmaill.com or liz@gnail.com, they&#8217;ll see a message with a suggestion of the proper spelling. They can click on the suggestion and the email address will be automatically fixed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443895\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart-email-feature.jpg\" alt=\"smart-email-feature\" width=\"562\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart-email-feature.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart-email-feature-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /><br />\nThe Smart Email feature works with 30 popular email service domains.</p>\n<p>We created the Smart Email feature because we know how important <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/beginners-guide-to-email-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email marketing</a> is to small business owners and website builders.</p>\n<p>Because of this, we wanted to help make the form entries you receive as accurate as possible. That way, you can focus on building your email list, not fixing it.</p>\n<p>The Smart Email feature is going to help you capture <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/best-wordpress-lead-generation-plugins-to-grow-your-email-list/\">higher quality leads</a>, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/12-tips-to-reduce-bounce-rate-and-boost-your-conversions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce bounces</a>, and get more <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-track-wordpress-form-conversions-step-by-step/\">conversions</a> by spotting common email domain typos right away and helping correct them.</p>\n<h3>Limit the Number of Checkboxes Users Can Select</h3>\n<p>The new Checkbox Total Limits feature lets you limit how many checkboxes users can pick on your form. We&#8217;re really excited about this great new option and think you will be too!</p>\n<p>Before, it was difficult to limit checkbox totals on a form. For instance, say your form had 10 dog breeds listed and you asked people to pick their 3 favorite. Users could&#8217;ve ignored your request and selected all 10 dog breeds!</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we made Checkbox Total Limits. It&#8217;s now easier than ever to build and manage different <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/insanely-easy-ways-to-grow-your-email-list-fast-starting-now/\">email lists</a> based on your visitor&#8217;s individual preferences.</p>\n<p>If a user tries to select more checkboxes than your set limit, the form will tell them they&#8217;ve exceeded the number of allowed selections.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443921\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/checkbox-total-limit-message.jpg\" alt=\"checkbox-total-limit-message\" width=\"562\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/checkbox-total-limit-message.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/checkbox-total-limit-message-300x242.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, the form won&#8217;t let them submit until that&#8217;s corrected.</p>\n<p>To set or change the Checkbox Total Limit in your Checkbox Field Options, simply click on Advanced Options and enter your desired numerical limit in the Choice Limit box. For a more in-depth look, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-limit-the-number-of-checkboxes-selections/\">how to limit the number of checkboxes selections.</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443726\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-edit-checkbox-total-limit-wpforms.jpg\" alt=\"how-to-edit-checkbox-total-limit-wpforms\" width=\"562\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-edit-checkbox-total-limit-wpforms.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-edit-checkbox-total-limit-wpforms-300x275.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>And that covers the newest release!</p>\n<p>We think you&#8217;ll agree that WPForms is smarter and simpler than ever before.</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>\n<p>Give the newest version of WPForms a try and let us know what you think about all the new updates.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for your continued support of WPForms.

If you’re wondering how to start an online store, then this guide is for you.</p>\n<p>Below, we&#8217;ve created a step-by-step walkthrough for how to start an online store that you can use to create your own store.

You can build an online store without writing a single line of code, we promise.</p>\n<p>To help you easily follow this guide, we have broken it down into 10 different sections:</p>\n\n<h2>Chapter 1: Deciding What to Sell</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-1-deciding-what-to-sell.png\" alt=\"chapter 1 deciding what to sell\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232929\" /></p>\n<p>Before you start building an online store, you need to decide what you’re going to sell. Choosing the right products to sell is important to the success of your online store. </p>\n<p>Overall, you need to sell products that online shoppers will want to buy. To help you determine what to sell on your online store, you’ll want to look at a number of factors, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Market Demand</strong> &#8211; Market demand describes the demand for a certain product and who wants to buy it. So, if the market demand for a product is high, then people are more likely to buy that product from your online store, and pay more for it too. You can research market demand by using a free tool like <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Keyword Planner Tool</a>. Type in the keywords for a product, for example, “organic face moisturizers”. If there’s a high search volume for those keywords, it shows there’s a lot of online shoppers searching for that product.</li>\n<li><strong>Competition</strong> &#8211; There may be a high demand for a product, but if there’s too much competition, your online store might not stand out from the crowd. So, it’s important to research your competition. Do a simple Google search for your product keywords and look at the companies that show up at the top of the search results. Determine how you’ll be different from them in order to convince shoppers to buy from your online store.</li>\n<li><strong>What’s Trending</strong> &#8211; If you can start selling products on your online store that are trending, you’ll be able to capture online shoppers before the competition does. So, stay on top of what’s trending. You can look at websites like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, and browse their “What’s Hot” and “Most Wished For” lists to find the newest, most wanted products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, whatever you choose to sell on your online store, it should be something you’re passionate about. Starting an online store in the hopes of making money, but choosing to sell something you’re not interested in or knowledgeable about, won’t bring you success. Your passion for the products should shine through on your website. If you truly enjoy and believe in the products you’re selling, online shoppers will be more likely to buy from you.</p>\n<p>To help you figure out what to sell on your online store, keep reading.</p>\n<h3>1.1. Digital vs. Physical Goods</h3>\n<p>First, you need to decide if you’re going to sell digital products or physical goods. Physical products have long been a popular choice for selling and buying online, but digital products are becoming increasingly more popular and valuable as well. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the differences of digital vs. physical products. </p>\n<h4>What is a Physical Product?</h4>\n<p>A physical product is a touchable, tangible product that you sell and ship to your customers. Clothing, furniture, food, beauty products, paintings, etc. are all physical products. </p>\n<p>Some examples of popular online stores that sell physical products include Amazon, Walmart, Target, American Apparel, and Best Buy. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/walmart-website.jpg\" alt=\"walmart-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"347\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232748\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/walmart-website.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/walmart-website-300x141.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h4>What is a Digital Product?</h4>\n<p>A digital product, also known as an e-good, is a non-tangible product or form of media that can be sold and distributed over and over again online without the need to replace your inventory. Digital products come in the form of downloadable files, PDFs, plugins, videos, streamable files, templates, etc. eBooks, software, audiobooks, music, and digital art are all examples of digital products. </p>\n<p>Some examples of popular online stores that sell digital products include Amazon’s Kindle Store, iTunes, Shutterstock, and Themify which sells WordPress themes.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kindle-store.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-kindle-store\" width=\"740\" height=\"314\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232749\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kindle-store.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kindle-store-300x127.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h4>Pros and Cons: Digital vs. Physical Products</h4>\n<p>There are pros and cons to selling both digital and physical products, you have to weigh the pros and cons in order to decide what type of product you should sell on your online store. </p>\n<p>So, let’s go over the pros and cons of each. </p>\n<p><strong>Physical Products</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear Value</strong> &#8211; Demonstrating the value of a physical product is very easy. The purpose of physical products is typically clear and easy to understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher Perceived Value</strong> &#8211; Since physical products are tangible, shoppers often associate them with a higher perceived value. </li>\n<li><strong>Easy to Use</strong> &#8211; With physical products, there’s typically not a lot of explanation, training, or follow-up involved. Just sell, ship, and the customer can use it right away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shipping Costs</strong> &#8211; Since you have to ship a physical product, you’ll have to consider the costs of shipping and handling. </li>\n<li><strong>More Time</strong> &#8211; Shipping a physical product to customers across the country takes time. </li>\n<li><strong>Storage</strong> &#8211; If you’re selling physical products, most of the time you need a lot of space to store your products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Digital Products</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Inventory</strong> &#8211; With digital products, you don’t have any inventory. That means you don’t have to deal with ordering a certain amount of units and storing them.</li>\n<li><strong>No Shipping Costs or Time</strong> &#8211; You don’t have to ship a digital product. Customers download digital products straight to their devices, which means they get the product instantly and you can send it for free as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Easier to Scale</strong> &#8211; Since you can sell the same digital product repeatedly and don’t have to deal with inventory or storage, it’s much easier to scale and grow your business. </li>\n<li><strong>Overall More Simple</strong> &#8211; For all of the reasons above, digital products are overall more simple to sell and easier to manage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Harder to Demonstrate Value</strong> &#8211; With a digital product, it’s harder to demonstrate value. It takes more work to convince customers that your digital product is worth buying. </li>\n<li><strong>Lower Perceived Value</strong> &#8211; Because a digital product is not something customers can hold in their hands, they’re associated with a lower perceived value. </li>\n<li><strong>Lots of Competition</strong> &#8211; Since digital products are so easy to sell online, a lot of people are doing it now. So, you’re likely to have a lot of competition. But there’s competition with selling physical products as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, there are pros and cons to selling both digital and physical products. Selling digital products is on the rise because it’s easy to get started selling digital products online. You don’t need to spend a lot of money to get started and you can sell the same product over and over again. But consumers are looking for physical products too. So, weigh the pros and cons, and decide which option is best for you. </p>\n<h3>1.2. Creating Your Own Products vs. Selling Established Products</h3>\n<p>Next, you need to decide if you want to create your own products or sell established products. </p>\n<p>If you want to create your own products then you have to understand it will take up a lot of your time. For instance, if you’re selling handknit scarves, you have to spend time creating a lot of inventory ahead of time or spend weeks creating a new item every time someone orders one, which will result in the customer having to wait much longer to receive their item. </p>\n<p>Aside from handmade products, creating your own physical product like the next best vacuum cleaner will take a lot of time, sometimes years, and you’ll have to spend a lot of money, which may not be the best route for you. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, creating your own digital product is much easier. For instance, if you decide to sell templates, you can create a template in a couple hours and sell it over and over again &#8212; much easier. </p>\n<p>Selling established products is the easiest way to go because you don’t have to spend any time building or creating the product. Plus, with certain existing products, much of the marketing is done for you as well. Shoppers will already be familiar with the product and its value, therefore, making the decision to buy will be easier for them. </p>\n<h3>1.3. Amazon Affiliate Store</h3>\n<p>Another type of online store you can create is an Amazon affiliate store. With an Amazon affiliate store, you can sell products on your website that Amazon carries. So, you don’t have to worry about creating your own products or dealing with storing inventory, shipping and handling, tracking stock, and so on. </p>\n<p>Amazon affiliate stores are managed through the <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Associates</a> program, which allows you to earn a percentage on each Amazon product that’s promoted and sold via your website.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-associates.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-associates\" width=\"740\" height=\"429\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232752\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-associates.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-associates-300x174.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Becoming an Amazon affiliate is free, all you have to do is sign up. Plus, you have the option of creating a new online store to list and sell Amazon products or you can use your existing website to sell their products and make money. </p>\n<p>For a step by step tutorial on how to start an Amazon affiliate store, check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/create-amazon-affiliate-store-wordpress-make-money/\">how to create an Amazon affiliate store with WordPress</a>. </p>\n<h3>1.4. Regular Sale vs. Subscription Model</h3>\n<p>When making an online store, you also have to decide if you’re going to use the regular sale model or use the subscription model. </p>\n<p>A regular sale, also known as a 1-time sale,  is when a customer buys a product and it’s delivered to them 1 time. If they want to order another product, they have to go on your website, buy it again, and then the item will be shipped to them a second time. </p>\n<p>But a subscription model is when customers pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. </p>\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.hellofresh.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hello Fresh</a> uses the subscription model. Customers pay a recurring fee and every week meal kits are delivered to them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hello-fresh.jpg\" alt=\"hello-fresh-subscription-service\" width=\"740\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232753\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hello-fresh.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hello-fresh-300x142.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /> </p>\n<p>Some other popular online stores that follow the subscription model include BarkBox, FabFitFun, and Netflix. </p>\n<p>You can sell digital products through the subscription model as well. Many software and plugin companies charge monthly fees to customers for using the product.</p>\n<p>When you sell a product to a customer 1 time, then you have to work hard to get them to buy again. But with a subscription model,  you have monthly recurring revenue you can count on. </p>\n<h2>Chapter 2: Setting the Right Expectations</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-2-setting-right-ecommerce-expectations.png\" alt=\"chapter 2 setting right ecommerce expectations\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232930\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-2-setting-right-ecommerce-expectations.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-2-setting-right-ecommerce-expectations-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Before starting your online store, you also need to set the right expectations. If you’re new to eCommerce, you might not be aware of the common mistakes new eCommerce websites make. Avoiding these beginner mistakes will help put your online store on the path to success. So, let’s take a look at some of the most common eCommerce mistakes. </p>\n<p><strong>Unrealistic Sales Expectations</strong><br />\nObviously, most people want to make an online store to make money. Some expect that all they need to do is build their website, add their products online, and the big bucks will start rolling in. But becoming a successful online store with loads of revenue takes time and work. So, you have to set realistic goals for your online store. Setting revenue goals and tracking them will help you see how well your online store is doing and how close you are to making your online store a fully fledged business. </p>\n<p>Set realistic goals for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Sales</li>\n<li>Monthly Sales</li>\n<li>Annual Sales</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these goals, you also have to consider the costs of running your online store. Your store will only be profitable if your sales exceed your costs. As your online store grows, you can adjust your goals and expectations to match. </p>\n<p><strong>No Target Audience</strong><br />\nNot everyone will be your customer. If you try to be everything to everyone, your online store won’t be successful. You need to decide who your target audience is and you need to design and market your online store with those people in mind. Plus, you need to give your audience a reason to shop with you instead of big websites like Amazon or Walmart. </p>\n<p>Create a customer profile for your ideal customer that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Demographics</strong> &#8211; Basic demographics of your target audience such as age, gender, location, occupation, lifestyle, etc. </li>\n<li><strong>Interests</strong> &#8211; What is your audience interested in? Cooking, camping, fashion, sports, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Values and Beliefs</strong> &#8211; Decide what’s important to your audience? Being ethical? Honest? </li>\n<li><strong>Pain Points</strong> &#8211; What issues/problems does your target audience face? And how does your online store help solve that problem?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Defining your target audience will help your business connect with shoppers and make more sales. </p>\n<p><strong>Poor Site Design</strong><br />\nMany new online store owners fail to realize the importance of good site design. Your website is often the first thing your customers will see. If the design of your online store is messy, unprofessional, and hard to navigate, shoppers won’t want to buy from you. </p>\n<p>So, make sure your online store has a modern theme, is easy to navigate, and looks great on mobile too. A professional logo that you can display on your eCommerce site also helps promote trust between shoppers and your website. </p>\n<p><strong>Poor Customer Service</strong><br />\nGood customer service is one of the most important parts of having a successful online store. Customers will want to know that you provide good customer service even before they make a purchase. You can prove this to them by adding a return policy to your website, providing support contact information like an email or phone number, or even adding live chat to your website.</p>\n<p>If you don’t provide quick, efficient customer service, you risk losing your customers. </p>\n<p>We’ll go over steps you can take to avoid these mistakes later on in the article. But first, you need to choose the right eCommerce platform and start building your website. </p>\n<h2>Chapter 3: Choosing an eCommerce Platform</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-3-ecommerce-platforms.png\" alt=\"chapter 3 ecommerce platforms\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232931\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-3-ecommerce-platforms.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-3-ecommerce-platforms-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Choosing the right eCommerce platform is critical for your business because it’s hard to back out if your decision turns out to be wrong. In fact, 60% of medium-to-large store owners agree that they should have conducted better due diligence before choosing their eCommerce platforms.</p>\n<p>3 of the  most popular eCommerce platforms that we recommend are <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/shopify/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Shopify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bigcommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >BigCommerce</a>, and WordPress + <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >WooCommerce</a>.<br />\nLet’s quickly take a look at each of these popular eCommerce platforms. </p>\n<h3>3.1. Best eCommerce Platforms Showdown</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/shopify/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Shopify</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/shopify/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shopify-website.jpg\" alt=\"shopify-website-builder\" width=\"740\" height=\"372\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231988\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shopify-website.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shopify-website-300x151.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Shopify is a fully-hosted eCommerce solution that starts at $29/month. Shopify makes it super easy to launch a store without having to install any software or maintain a web hosting server.</p>\n<p>While it allows you to customize the design of your store, the customization options are limited when compared to a self-hosted eCommerce platform. You’ll also have to pay transaction fees for every order in addition to the monthly fee. That means that your real cost is going to be higher than $29 per month, and it’ll increase as your store grows.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>User-friendly and easy to learn.</li>\n<li>Shopify manages your online store for you.</li>\n<li>Scaling your website is easy and affordable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t have full control of your site.</li>\n<li>You have to pay transaction fees. </li>\n<li>Limited customization due to not being able to choose the features you want.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bigcommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >BigCommerce</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bigcommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bigcommerce-site.jpg\" alt=\"bigcommerce-ecommerce-platform\" width=\"740\" height=\"393\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230068\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bigcommerce-site.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bigcommerce-site-300x159.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>BigCommerce is another fully-hosted eCommerce solution. That means you can quickly make an online store without having to manage any of the technical aspects. Simply create an account with BigCommerce, design your online store in an instant using 1 of their many sleek eCommerce templates, add your products, and start selling. </p>\n<p>You can get started with BigCommerce for only $29.95 per month which includes unlimited products, file storage, and bandwidth. In addition, with BigCommerce there are no transaction fees for using leading payment gateways unlike with Shopify.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>User-friendly and easy to start a site. </li>\n<li>No transaction fees.</li>\n<li>It’s a fully hosted solution, you don’t have to worry about managing your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t have complete control over your site.</li>\n<li>Customization for your site is limited, only a few free themes to choose from for example.</li>\n<li>Annual online sale limits, if you exceed the limit you have to upgrade your plan. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >WooCommerce</a></h4>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Insert woocommerce image**</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>With a self-hosted eCommerce solution like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce</a>, you’ll get full control over your online store. WooCommerce is the platform of choice for almost 28% of all online stores. Best of all, it works on top of WordPress as a free plugin, so if you are familiar with WordPress, then you can easily manage a store with WooCommerce. In addition, if you already have a WordPress website or blog, you can easily turn it into an online store using WooCommerce.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>WooCommerce comes with a number of built-in features like shipping, payment processing, inventory management, coupons, reporting, and more. You also have the ability to purchase WooCommerce extensions to add more power to your online store or use a number of third-party free and paid <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-woocommerce-plugins-grow-sales-rapidly/\">WooCommerce plugins</a> to help grow your sales.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Plus, since WooCommerce is an open source platform and a WordPress eCommerce plugin, it’s free to download from the WordPress.org repository. To get started with WooCommerce, all you need is a domain name, SSL certificate, and web hosting account. With some of the best web hosting companies, you can get all this for as little as $3-5/month, making WooCommerce the most low cost way to start an online store. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full control of your site. </li>\n<li>WooCommerce is an open source software, customization is endless with addons. </li>\n<li>More affordable than other eCommerce platforms.</li>\n<li>More affordable managed web hosting options that are WooCommerce-specific. </li>\n<li>No transaction fees. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to manage your own site including security, updates, backups, and so on.</li>\n<li>The unlimited features can make it a bit overwhelming to learn.</li>\n<li>Scaling your online store is more difficult, since you have to manage your site yourself or pay more for managed web hosting. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It’s important to note that to use the WooCommerce WordPress plugin, you need to build your site with WordPress.org, not WordPress.com. Check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-one-really-better/\">WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org</a> to learn more about the difference between the 2.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<h3>3.2. Why We Recommend WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>While eCommerce platforms such as Shopify and BigCommerce are a bit easier to use and come with everything you need out of the box to easily set up an online store, WooCommerce comes with a lower starting cost and you have more control of your site. </p>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you have complete control of how your online store looks and performs. Just as we suggest making a website with WordPress because of the endless customization options, the same goes for making an online store with WooCommerce. An online store with WooCommerce allows you to use numerous WordPress plugins to add more features to your online store. </p>\n<p>Plus, you get access to tons of amazing <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-woocommerce-themes-online-store/\">WooCommerce themes</a> to give your store exactly the look you desire.  It also comes with integrations, payment methods, addons, and more. </p>\n<p>Since the WooCommerce and the WordPress community is so large, if you ever run into an issue with your online store, there are a ton of online communities and forums available to help you out.</p>\n<p>Creating an online store with WooCommerce allows you to create exactly the kind of eCommerce website you want, without having to spend a large portion of your budget.  </p>\n<h3>3.3. Prerequisites for an Online Store (Domain, Hosting, SSL, etc.)</h3>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, when you create an online store with WooCommerce, there’s a couple things you need before you get started. Since WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin, you need a self-hosted WordPress site along with these 3 things: domain name, SSL certificate, and web hosting. Let’s go over what each of these prerequisites are and why you need them.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain Name</strong><br />\nA domain name is the address of your website. Users can type your domain name into the address bar of their browser and get access to your website. For instance, some popular domain names you might be familiar with include www.IsItWP.com,  www.Amazon.com, www.Facebook.com, and www.WPBeginner.com.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/domain-name-address-bar.jpg\" alt=\"domain-name-hosting-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"370\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232166\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/domain-name-address-bar.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/domain-name-address-bar-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Without a domain name, users won’t be able to visit your eCommerce website from their own computers. So, if you want to create an online store, you’ll need to purchase a domain name that matches the brand name of your online store. </p>\n<p>For a more detailed explanation, check out our article: <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/domain-name-work/\">What is a Domain Name and How Does it Work?</a></p>\n<p><strong>SSL Certificate</strong><br />\nAn SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer), also known as a digital certificate, creates a secure link between a website and a visitor’s browser. This ensures that all the data that’s passed between your shoppers and your website is safe and secure. An SSL certificate is needed on any website that will be accepting credit card information. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ssl-certificate.jpg\" alt=\"ssl-certificate\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232761\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ssl-certificate.jpg 500w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ssl-certificate-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ssl-certificate-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>In addition, displaying an SSL certificate on your site builds trust between your website and your customers. If your online store isn’t secure, users won’t want to buy from you. But an SSL certificate shows them that their information is in safe hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Web Hosting</strong><br />\nWhen creating an eCommerce website with self-hosted WordPress and WooCommerce, you also need to purchase web hosting. When you build a website, all the files are stored on your computer and nobody else can view them. But when you purchase web hosting, a web hosting company stores your website files in a space on the web so that other users can visit your website. </p>\n<p>Web hosting is basically where your site lives on the internet. Just like a retail store needs a physical location that shoppers can walk into, your online store needs a space on the web that users can visit too. Web hosting will provide that to you. </p>\n<p>If you’re afraid that all of these prerequisites will be costly, don’t worry. We’ll show you how you can get a free domain name, free SSL certificate, and affordable web hosting in the next couple sections.</p>\n<h3>3.4. How to Choose a Brand Name</h3>\n<p>Choosing a brand name is important. A brand name is basically the name of your online store. Your brand name should typically match your domain name as well. For instance, think about the most popular online store on the web, Amazon. Their brand name is Amazon and their domain name is www.Amazon.com. Having your brand name and your domain name the same makes it easy for shoppers to remember and find your website on the internet. </p>\n<p>But you can’t just pick a brand name at random. Instead, you need to choose a brand name that makes you stand out from the competition. So, how do you choose the best brand name for your online store? Here are some tips for picking the best brand name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep it Short and Simple</strong> &#8211; Your brand name should be short and simple so that it’s easy for your customers to remember and spell. Longer, complicated brand names can get misspelled when customers type your domain name into their address bar, resulting in them not being able to find your online store.</li>\n<li><strong>Be Unique</strong> &#8211; With so many online stores on the web, your brand name needs to be unique to stand out from the crowd. Take a look at your competition, if they use the word “electronics” in their brand name, come up with a different word you can use to set yourself apart. </li>\n<li><strong>Use Keywords</strong> &#8211; Using keywords in your brand name will help your online store get found by more people online. For instance, if your online store sells shoes, consider adding the word “shoes” to your brand name to boost your organic search results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To boost your inspiration, here are some examples of awesome, unique brand names:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/death-wish-coffee.jpg\" alt=\"death-wish-coffee\" width=\"740\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232762\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/death-wish-coffee.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/death-wish-coffee-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/death-wish-coffee-330x160.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Death Wish Coffee</a> &#8211; The World’s Strongest Coffee</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fuegobox.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Fuego Box</a> &#8211; Hot Sauce of the Month Club/Subscription Box</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.superinkclothing.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Super Ink Clothing</a> &#8211; Printed Clothing and Accessories</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tattly.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tattly</a> &#8211; Temporary Tattoos for Adults</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hellolucky.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hello!Lucky</a> &#8211; Letterpress Greeting Card and Design Studio</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re having trouble coming up with a brand name, you can also use our free <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/domain-name-generator/\">Domain Name Generator</a> to help you come up with something awesome. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/domain-name-generator/\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/isitwp-domain-generator1.jpg\" alt=\"isitwp-domain-name-generator\" width=\"740\" height=\"329\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232763\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/isitwp-domain-generator1.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/isitwp-domain-generator1-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Simply type in a 1 or 2 keywords and the tool will provide you with a number of brand name ideas. The tool also checks for domain name availability, so you don’t have to worry about picking a name that someone else has already taken. </p>\n<p>After you’ve found the perfect brand name, it’s time to choose web hosting and purchase a domain name.</p>\n<h3>3.5. How to Choose Web Hosting</h3>\n<p>Choosing the best web hosting is another important step in making an online store.  You need to choose a high-performance web hosting solution in order to provide a fast and convenient shopping experience to your customers. If your eCommerce website is slow, even just a 1-second delay, it could decrease your sales by 7%. As you can see, it’s important to choose a web hosting that has top-notch speed and performance. </p>\n<p>There are a few other factors you should consider when choosing the best eCommerce web hosting including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1-Click Install</strong> &#8211; The web hosting you choose should offer 1-click, easy installation of your preferred eCommerce app such as WooCommerce. </li>\n<li><strong>SSL Certificate</strong> &#8211; As we mentioned earlier, you need an SSL certificate to protect your online store.

If you can point-and-click, then you can follow this tutorial and have your online store up and running in no time.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how to set up an online store in WordPress using WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>4.1. Purchase a Domain Name and a WooCommerce Hosting Account</h3>\n<p>To start your WooCommerce store, head over to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost-woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost website</a> and click the <strong>Get Started Now</strong> button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost-woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting.jpg\" alt=\"bluehost woocommerce hosting\" width=\"775\" height=\"495\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218434\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-768x491.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></a></p>\n<p>On the next page, you’ll be asked to choose a plan.

This is required for you to run an online store and accept credit card payments.</p>\n<p>Since you’re just getting started, you can choose the starter plan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-plan.jpg\" alt=\"bluehost woocommerce hosting plan\" width=\"775\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218433\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-plan.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-plan-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-plan-768x495.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can either choose to use an existing domain that you have or get a free new domain.

You can select the starter plan for 12 months, 24 months, or 36 months. You will also see that a few addons are preselected which are increasing your total price. We recommend that you uncheck these boxes because you can always add them later should you decide that you need these services.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information.png\" alt=\"bluehost package information\" width=\"775\" height=\"388\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218436\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information-300x150.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you need to scroll down the page further to enter your payment details. You will also be asked to Agree to their Terms of Service, and then click Submit.</p>\n<p>That’s it!</p>\n<p>You’ve successfully subscribed to a WooCommerce hosting plan. You’ll now receive an email with details on how to log in to your web hosting control panel (cPanel) where you can manage everything from hosting files to emails and support.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and log into your cPanel. You’ll be greeted with a popup informing you that WordPress, along with WooCommerce, has been pre-installed. You can now click <strong>log into your site</strong> and start managing your online store.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bh-login.png\" alt=\"woocommerce installed\" width=\"520\" height=\"289\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218437\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bh-login.png 520w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bh-login-300x167.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" /></p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at how to launch your online store with WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>4.2. Configure WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>Using the login credentials from your email, you need to login to your WordPress dashboard where you’ll see a welcome message. Go ahead and click the <strong>I don’t need help link</strong>. Don’t worry, we’ll walk you through every step of the process.</p>\n<p>The first step is to make sure that you specify the name and tagline of your site. To do this, you need to visit <strong>Settings &raquo; General</strong> page and insert your WordPress site title and description.</p>\n<p>Your WordPress hosting package came with a free SSL Certificate. This certificate is pre-installed for your domain name. However, your WordPress site needs to be configured, so it loads as https vs http. You&#8217;ll also need to change your WordPress Address and Site Address to use https instead of http.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-welcome-message-on-bluehost.png\" alt=\"wordpress welcome message on bluehost\" width=\"775\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218438\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-welcome-message-on-bluehost.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-welcome-message-on-bluehost-300x139.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-welcome-message-on-bluehost-768x357.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you need to run the WooCommerce setup wizard. Simply click the <strong>Run the Setup Wizard</strong> button. The setup wizard will walk you through the basic configuration of WooCommerce storefront.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-setup-wizard.png\" alt=\"woocommerce setup wizard\" width=\"775\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218439\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-setup-wizard.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-setup-wizard-300x149.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-setup-wizard-768x381.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>In the first step, you’ll be asked to specify your store’s location. You’ll also be prompted to select the currency you’d like to use. After completing the first step, you can proceed to the Payment step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-store-setup.png\" alt=\"woocommerce store setup\" width=\"775\" height=\"501\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218430\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-store-setup.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-store-setup-300x194.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-store-setup-768x496.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>By default, WooCommerce only allows you to accept payments via PayPal. You can simply enter your PayPal email in this step without linking your PayPal account. If you want to add additional payment methods, then you&#8217;ll need to install respective addons (which you can do later).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-payment.png\" alt=\"woocommerce payment\" width=\"775\" height=\"478\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218426\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-payment.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-payment-300x185.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-payment-768x474.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>If you choose to sell physical goods on your WooCommerce store, then you’ll be asked to setup shipping methods and shipping fees for both national and international shipping.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-shipping.png\" alt=\"woocommerce shipping\" width=\"775\" height=\"501\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218429\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-shipping.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-shipping-300x194.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-shipping-768x496.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>After setting up the shipping options, WooCommerce will persuade you to connect your site with Jetpack. Setting up Jetpack is not a necessary step for building a WooCommerce store, so you can skip it. You can find the <strong>Skip this step</strong> option at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-with-jetpack.png\" alt=\"woocommerce with jetpack\" width=\"775\" height=\"498\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218431\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-with-jetpack.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-with-jetpack-300x193.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-with-jetpack-768x494.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You’re done with the setup wizard. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-ready.png\" alt=\"woocommerce ready\" width=\"775\" height=\"422\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218428\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-ready.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-ready-300x163.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-ready-768x418.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.3. Change Your WordPress Theme</h3>\n<p>WordPress themes control the visual appearance of your website. To give a unique <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-web-design-software/\" title=\"10 Best Web Design Software You Don’t Want to Miss\">design to your website</a>, all you have to do is find and install the right theme on it. With WordPress, you can customize an existing theme or even install a custom-built theme per your unique requirements.</p>\n<p>By default, your WooCommerce store comes preinstalled with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-themes/storefront/\" target=\"_blank\">the Storefront theme</a>. Storefront is a free WordPress theme offering deep integration with WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>If you want to customize your Storefront theme without touching a single line of code, then you can get the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/storefront-extension-bundle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storefront Extensions Bundle</a> that helps you delight your customers with a unique look.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can easily find another WooCommerce-compatible theme in the free plugin repository. Before you choose a random theme from the official directory, it’s in your best interest to take a look at <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-wordpress-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">some WooCommerce compatible theme reviews</a>, and decide which one would be a perfect choice for your needs.</p>\n<p>A premium theme has to be downloaded from the theme vendor’s site and manually uploaded to your WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you decide to go with a free WordPress theme from the official theme repository, then you can search and install it directly from your WordPress dashboard without having to download it to your computer.</p>\n<p>To install a free theme, navigate to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Themes</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Then click the <strong>Add New Theme</strong> box. You can now find some featured themes in your dashboard. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box.png\" alt=\"add new theme\" width=\"775\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218261\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box-300x178.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box-768x457.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Before installing, you can preview your theme by clicking on the thumbnails displayed. You can also filter themes based on layouts, features, and niches by clicking on the <strong>Feature Filter</strong>button.</p>\n<p>Since you are looking for an eCommerce theme, you can simply check the <strong>E-commerce</strong> option in the subject column. This way it&#8217;ll only show you eCommerce-compatible themes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/filter-ecommerce-theme.jpg\" alt=\"filter eCommerce theme\" width=\"775\" height=\"392\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218424\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/filter-ecommerce-theme.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/filter-ecommerce-theme-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/filter-ecommerce-theme-768x388.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>In the right-hand corner, type the theme name in the search bar. Once you’ve found the right theme, hover on its image and click the <strong>Install</strong> button. Then click <strong>Activate</strong> to change your website’s appearance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install.png\" alt=\"theme install\" width=\"775\" height=\"416\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218258\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install-300x161.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install-768x412.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.4. Extend Your Online Store With Plugins</h3>\n<p>WooCommerce supports tons of different addon plugins that let you enhance your online store without writing code or hiring a developer.</p>\n<p>Just like WordPress themes, you can easily find and install free plugins from the WordPress plugin repository within your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is visit <strong>Plugins &raquo; Add New</strong>. Use the search box in the right corner to find a plugin and click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button. And then, click <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"install a plugin\" width=\"775\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218371\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin-768x431.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"wordpress\">Chapter 5: Getting Started with Your Online Store</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-5-getting-started-online-store.png\" alt=\"chapter 5 getting started online store\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232923\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-5-getting-started-online-store.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-5-getting-started-online-store-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress is a fully-featured website builder solution that gives you endless possibilities to customize your site the way you want. Unlike other popular eCommerce solutions, WordPress makes it easy to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\" target=\"_blank\">integrate a blog</a> with your online store and create standalone web pages.</p>\n<p>If you’ve never used WordPress before, then we’ll walk you through how to kick start a fully-featured website along with your online store. Below are the things we&#8217;ll cover:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a blog to your online store</li>\n<li>Create standalone pages</li>\n<li>Add a navigation menu</li>\n<li>Add a widget</li>\n<li>Setup a static homepage</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>5.1. Add a Blog to Your Online Store</h3>\n<p>Do you want to help your eCommerce customers stay connected with your brand? Want to attract more website visitors, generate more sales and revenue? Then, you need to integrate a blog with your online store.</p>\n<p>Every eCommerce business needs a blog. By integrating a blog with your store, you can update your brand’s news and stay connected with your customers. Keeping a regular blog is one of the best ways to drive organic traffic to your site as well.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how to create and publish a blog post in your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>In the left-hand menu of your WordPress dashboard, you&#8217;ll find two similar options that may confuse you as a new user: <strong>Posts</strong> and <strong>Pages</strong>.</p>\n<p>Choose <strong>Posts</strong> if you want to create a website post that appears in reverse chronological order (newest first) on your WordPress website. Posts are also organized into categories and tags. You can read the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/categories-vs-tags-seo-best-practices-which-one-is-better/\" target=\"_blank\">difference between categories and tags</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>To create your first blog post, head over to your post editor by going to <strong>Posts &raquo; Add New</strong>. You need to start by adding a title for your blog post. After that, you can start writing your blog post content in the post editor.

Reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment with OptinMonster</h3>\n<p>Did you know the average online shopping cart abandonment rate is around 70%? That means only 3 out of 10 customers are completing the checkout.</p>\n<p>Evidently, shopping cart abandonment is the single largest obstacle for eCommerce business to overcome. But, you can reduce shopping cart abandonment with a plugin like <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a>.</p>\n<p>OptinMonster is a popular lead generation tool that allows you to display targeted popups that convert abandoning visitors into subscribers. </p>\n<p>For instance, when a customer is about to leave your site before completing the checkout, you can prompt them to complete it with a targeted popup campaign. You can use OptinMonster’s exit intent technology to display a targeted campaign.</p>\n<p>To create a targeted exit-intent popup campaign, first create an account with <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> on their official website. Once you’ve signed up for an account, you can start creating your first exit-intent popup campaign to reduce cart abandonment. First, click on the green <strong>Create Campaign</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Create-Campaign.jpg\" alt=\"create-optinmonster-campaign\" width=\"740\" height=\"130\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232830\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Create-Campaign.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Create-Campaign-300x53.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, choose the campaign type by clicking on <strong>Popup</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/campaign-type.jpg\" alt=\"optinmonster-campaign-type\" width=\"740\" height=\"269\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232824\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/campaign-type.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/campaign-type-300x109.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you’ll be prompted to choose a pre-designed template for your campaign. OptinMonster has a pre-built template specifically for shopping cart abandonment, so let’s choose that one, titled <strong>Abandoning Checkout</strong>. Hover over the template and click the <strong>Use Template</strong> button. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/templates-optinmonster.jpg\" alt=\"optinmonster-abandoned-cart-template\" width=\"740\" height=\"446\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232826\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/templates-optinmonster.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/templates-optinmonster-300x181.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>After clicking the <strong>Use Template</strong> button, you’ll be prompted to name your campaign and choose which website your popup will go on.

You can also choose the level of sensitivity of the exit-intent to be low, medium, or high. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-exit-intent.jpg\" alt=\"exit-detected-display-rule\" width=\"740\" height=\"357\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232828\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-exit-intent.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-exit-intent-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/choose-exit-intent-330x160.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also add other rules such as only showing the popup to users who have visited your checkout page as well. Play around with the rules to see what works best for you.</p>\n<p>After designing your campaign, setting the display rules and making sure your campaign is connected to your email marketing service, hit the green <strong>Save</strong> button, then click on <strong>Publish</strong>.<br />\nFrom here, toggle your campaign to <strong>Live</strong> in the <strong>Status</strong> section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-optinmonster.jpg\" alt=\"live-optinmonster-campaign\" width=\"740\" height=\"183\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232829\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-optinmonster.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/live-optinmonster-300x74.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>In the platform section, select WordPress, and follow the simple instructions to embed the campaign on your website. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/embed-instructions.jpg\" alt=\"embed-optinmonster-campaign-instructions\" width=\"740\" height=\"332\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232831\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/embed-instructions.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/embed-instructions-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Now instead of losing precious sales, you’ll be able to convert those abandoning visitors into happy customers.<br />\nSome other ways to reduce shopping cart abandonment include adding security badges to your site and offering guest checkout. Adding a security badge helps instill confidence in your customers and guest checkout makes it easy for your customers to complete an order, so they don’t have to create an account.</p>\n<h2>Chapter 7: Adding Your First Products</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-7-add-first-products.png\" alt=\"chapter 7 add first products\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232925\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-7-add-first-products.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chapter-7-add-first-products-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can now start listing your products in your store by clicking the <strong>Create a Product</strong> button.

The type of website you want to make is an important step in figuring out how your website should look and what you need on your website. </p>\n<p>There are a number of different types of websites. We’ll go over a few of them below to help you decide what type of website you want to make. </p>\n<p><strong>Online Store</strong><br />\nAn online store, otherwise known as an eCommerce website, is where people can purchase products directly from your site. You’ve probably visited a number of eCommerce websites before, most big brands have them such as <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and so on. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-ecommerce-site.jpg\" alt=\"amazon-ecommerce-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231905\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-ecommerce-site.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-ecommerce-site-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amazon-ecommerce-site-330x160.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can visit these websites, purchase a product online, and have it shipped to you. But online stores aren’t just for big brands, smaller companies can have them too. </p>\n<p>On an eCommerce website, you’ll need to list the products you have for sale, that includes an image, product description, and price. You also need a shopping cart and a checkout page where visitors can enter in their payment information to make a purchase. </p>\n<p>So, if you plan to sell products on your website, you’ll want to create an online store. </p>\n<p><strong>Blog</strong><br />\nA blog is an informational website with regularly updated posts/articles written in an informal, conversational style presented in reverse chronological order (newest blog posts first). When blogs were first introduced, people mainly used them as a type of online diary where they would share what they ate for breakfast, what they did that day, shared their thoughts, and so on. </p>\n<p>But today, blogs are much more than that. Blogs aren’t just for fun anymore, you can actually make money from a blog by adding ads and affiliate links. Plus, people can visit blog websites not just to read about someone’s life, but to learn about a wide variety of topics. Some popular blogging niches include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lifestyle</li>\n<li>Tech</li>\n<li>Entrepreneurship</li>\n<li>Food/Recipes</li>\n<li>Parenting</li>\n<li>Health/Fitness</li>\n<li>Travel</li>\n<li>Finances/Budgeting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some popular examples of blogs include our own, IsItWP,  as well as <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WPBeginner</a>, <a href=\"https://pinchofyum.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pinch of Yum</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pinch-of-yum.jpg\" alt=\"blog-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"408\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231906\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pinch-of-yum.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pinch-of-yum-300x165.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to share your knowledge on a particular topic, you should choose to start a blog website. </p>\n<p>For more detailed information, check out our post on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/blog-vs-website/\">what is a blog</a> and the differences between a blog and a website.</p>\n<p><strong>Forums</strong><br />\nA forum website is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. This is different from a live chat website because forums are almost never live and the messages can be read at any time by anyone on the website.  </p>\n<p>A forum website, also known as a message board, is an opportunity for like-minded people to come together to discuss a wide variety of topics. Forums are usually organized and arranged into different topics so that users can easily find what they’re looking for. </p>\n<p>Some popular forum websites include <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Quora</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a>.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/reddit-forum-site.jpg\" alt=\"reddit-forum-site\" width=\"740\" height=\"365\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231907\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/reddit-forum-site.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/reddit-forum-site-300x148.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to create an online community for users to discuss a topic or a variety of topics, consider creating a forum website. </p>\n<p><strong>Niche Social Network</strong><br />\nWe’ve all heard of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, which are platforms that boast billions of users. But a niche social network site targets only a particular segment of the general population. </p>\n<p>On a niche social network, users can form connections with others that are similar to themselves or interested in the same subjects. For instance, you could create a niche social network for dog owners or for professional musicians. </p>\n<p>Some popular niche social networks include <a href=\"https://www.classmates.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Classmates</a>, <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Last.fm</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Meetup</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/classmates-niche-social-network.jpg\" alt=\"classmates-niche-social-network\" width=\"740\" height=\"401\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231908\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/classmates-niche-social-network.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/classmates-niche-social-network-300x163.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Want to create a tight-knight community that allows like-minded people to connect with each other? Start a niche social network site. </p>\n<p><strong>Membership Site</strong><br />\nA membership site is a gated website where only the people who have subscribed can access the content behind the gate. The “gate” is simply a barrier that you put on the front of your website, where users have to log in to get access to your exclusive content, special offers, or to interact with the community. A membership site can be paid, free, or a bit of both. </p>\n<p>You can easily turn any website into a membership site using a WordPress plugin like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/memberpress/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >MemberPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Some popular membership sites include <a href=\"https://insider.wishlistproducts.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wishlist Insider</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quietspeculation.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet Speculation</a>, and <a href=\"https://my.copyblogger.com/authority-opt-in-to-wait-list/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Authority by CopyBlogger</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wishlist-insider-membership-site.jpg\" alt=\"wishlist-insider-membership-site\" width=\"740\" height=\"356\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231909\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wishlist-insider-membership-site.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wishlist-insider-membership-site-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wishlist-insider-membership-site-330x160.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /> </p>\n<p>If you want to create a website with a VIP feel, consider creating a membership site.  </p>\n<p><strong>Static Business Site</strong><br />\nAnother popular type of website is a static business site. A static business site is an unchanging, rarely updated website that represents and promotes a specific business. This type of website exists so that people can discover your business online and preview what you have to offer. </p>\n<p>A static business site may include the address of your business, your phone number, a contact page, and an overview of what your business does. They also typically include an About page so your potential customers can get to know you and your credentials, a list of the services you offer, business photos, and reviews or testimonials. </p>\n<p>Some examples of static business sites include <a href=\"https://awesomemotive.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Motive</a> and small business websites like <a href=\"https://www.newecolandscapes.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">New Eco Landscapes</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/awesomemotive.jpg\" alt=\"awesome-motive-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228394\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/awesomemotive.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/awesomemotive-300x156.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>So, if you want to create an online presence for your small business and don’t have products to sell online, choose a static business site. </p>\n<p>Hopefully, you’ve now decided what type of website you should make. The next step is to start building it! But first, you’ve got to choose the right website builder. </p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#why\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 1 &#8211; Why Start a Website?</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"builder\">Chapter 3: Choosing a Website Builder</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-3-choosing-a-site-builder.png\" alt=\"chapter 3 choosing a site builder\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232327\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-3-choosing-a-site-builder.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-3-choosing-a-site-builder-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Building a website used to be difficult. If you wanted your own website, you would have to start building it from scratch, which requires an expert level of coding skills. Or you would have to hire a web designer to build it for you, which could be quite expensive. Luckily, that’s not the case anymore.</p>\n<p>There are a number of website builders on the market that allow you to easily build a website in no time. But not all website builders are created equally. And with so many to choose from, how do you know which website builder is best for you? </p>\n<p>In the next section, we’ll go over some of the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-website-builders-for-beginners-compared/\">best website builders</a>.

You can design your own website starting with a blank slate or you can choose from over 500 designer-made templates that will give your website a professional look in an instant. You can also add video backgrounds, animations, and more, easily. </p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free</strong> &#8211; You can get started with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wix/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Wix</a> for free. Their free plan allows you to create a simple drag and drop website with limited features.</li>\n<li><strong>Responsive Design</strong> &#8211; Any website you create with Wix will be optimized for mobile, tablets, and desktops.

You have to upgrade to a premium plan to get access to more features, and even then it’s still limited compared to other website builders. For instance, if you want to accept online payments on your website, you need to upgrade to a business plan starting at $20 per month. </li>\n<li><strong>No Export</strong> &#8211; Wix offers no way to export your website data. So, if you want to move your website to another platform in the future, there’s no easy way to do so. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong><br />\nYou can build a simple website for free with Wix. But to get access to more powerful features and remove Wix-branded ads, you have to upgrade to a paid website plan. These plans range from $5/month &#8211; $29/month. As we mentioned earlier, if you want to start an eCommerce website with Wix, you’ll need to upgrade to a Business &#038; eCommerce plan, ranging from $20/month &#8211; $35/month. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/godaddy-website-builder/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >GoDaddy Website Builder</a></strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/godaddy-website-builder/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/godaddy-website-builder.jpg\" alt=\"godaddy-website-builder\" width=\"740\" height=\"326\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231987\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/godaddy-website-builder.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/godaddy-website-builder-300x132.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>GoDaddy is a well-known domain registrar and hosting service provider, but they also offer a simple drag and drop website builder.

Why Do We Recommend WordPress.org?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> is by far the best choice for building a website. It’s the most popular website builder for a reason. You can use WordPress to build any type of website you want, whether it’s a business website, blog, membership site, forum site, eCommerce site, and so on. Plus, with WordPress, you get instant access to any feature you need to make your website successful. </p>\n<p>Let’s quickly go over the reasons why WordPress.org is the best website builder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free</strong> &#8211; WordPress is free to use. You need to purchase a domain name and web hosting but even with those costs, WordPress is still one of the most affordable website builders out there. </li>\n<li><strong>Popular</strong> &#8211; Powering over 30% of all websites online, WordPress is the most used website builder by far.

But with WordPress, you get access to thousands of free plugins instantly. Not only that but they also offer thousands of free themes as well. </li>\n<li><strong>Easy to Use</strong> &#8211; While WordPress takes some getting used to, it’s actually very simple and easy to use.

It powers over 30% of all websites today.</p>\n<p>WordPress makes it incredibly simple to build a website from scratch. You can easily customize the appearance and features of your site by installing the right theme and plugins (apps) respectively. </p>\n<p>The best part is, you don&#8217;t need to know any code or be tech savvy. We’ll help you get your WordPress website up and running in less than an hour. All you have to do is follow the step by step guide below.   </p>\n<h3>4.1. Choosing a Platform &#8211; Self Hosted WordPress</h3>\n<p>Because there are tons of different website builders to choose from, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Even though many website builders are free to use, we always recommend starting a website on a self-hosted WordPress platform.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress\" width=\"775\" height=\"346\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218393\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-768x343.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>With a free website builder, you can&#8217;t set up a custom domain name. For example, you won&#8217;t be able to get a custom domain like:</p>\n<p>www.mycoolwebsite.com </p>\n<p>Instead, you&#8217;d be stuck with something like:</p>\n<p>www.freewebsitebuilder.com/mycoolwebsite.com. </p>\n<p>Which is not as professional and it&#8217;s more difficult for your visitors to remember. A free website builder also displays irrelevant ads, which makes your website look unprofessional as well and can annoy your visitors. If you want to set up a custom domain name and remove their ads, then almost every website builder requires you to subscribe to a premium plan which is quite expensive. </p>\n<p>Another disadvantage is that the interface of most website builders come bundled with a lot of bloated options that you’ll probably never need. This makes creating a website a tedious task for novice users.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a self-hosted WordPress platform gives you full control over your site. The interface is tidy, and you can easily expand the features of your site by simply installing the plugins you need. Plus, WordPress offers thousands of free plugins, this allows you to make your site more powerful at no cost. </p>\n<p>Additionally, you can find thousands of free WordPress themes from the official theme repository that enable you easily customize the appearance of your site the way you want.</p>\n<h3>4.2. Purchase a Domain Name and a Hosting Account</h3>\n<p>To start a website on self-hosted WordPress.org, you’ll have to own a domain name and a web hosting account.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain name</strong>: Your domain name is your website’s address (URL) on the internet, like Google.com or IsItWP.com. It’s what your customers type in their browsers to access your website. A domain name usually costs around $14.99 per year.</p>\n<p><strong>Web hosting</strong>: Your web hosting account is where your website’s content and files are stored online. Think of it as your website&#8217;s physical house. When a visitor tries to access your website by typing in your web address (domain name), they’ll be directed to the website you&#8217;ve set up in your web hosting server. <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Web hosting</a> typically costs $7.99 per month.</p>\n<p>The combined cost of a domain name and hosting can be quite expensive, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out. </p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve worked out a deal with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> to offer our users a FREE domain name and over 60% off on web hosting.

You can always upgrade later as your site grows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/select-a-bluehost-plan-to-start-a-blog.jpg\" alt=\"select a bluehost plan to start a website\" width=\"775\" height=\"483\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218256\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/select-a-bluehost-plan-to-start-a-blog.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/select-a-bluehost-plan-to-start-a-blog-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/select-a-bluehost-plan-to-start-a-blog-768x479.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>On the next screen, you with be asked to choose an existing domain you own or you can purchase a new domain for free.

You can select the basic plan for 12 months, 24 months or 36 months. You can also see that a few addons are preselected, adding up the total price. We recommend unchecking the addons because you won&#8217;t need these right away. You can always purchase them later if your needs change.</p>\n<p>Choosing the 36 months plan will get you the best value for your money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information.jpg\" alt=\"bluehost package information\" width=\"775\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218263\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bluehost-package-information-768x357.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done choosing your plans, scroll down the page further to enter your payment details. You have to agree to their Terms of Service and then, click Submit.</p>\n<p>That’s it!</p>\n<p>You’ve successfully subscribed to a hosting plan. You&#8217;ll be asked to create a password for your account. </p>\n<p>Next, you’ll receive an email with details on how to log in to your web hosting control panel (cPanel) where you can manage everything from hosting files to emails and support.</p>\n<h3>4.3. Install WordPress on Your Web Host</h3>\n<p>With Bluehost, you don&#8217;t have to go through a separate WordPress installation process because Bluehost now installs WordPress by default. All you have to do is <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-wordpress-themes/\" title=\"Top WordPress themes\" target=\"_blank\">choose your WordPress theme</a>, specify the name and tagline for your website, and you&#8217;ll be ready to get started with WordPress. </p>\n<p>After subscribing to your hosting plan, you&#8217;ll be prompted to choose a WordPress theme. You can just pick anything during this step because you can always change your theme later (we&#8217;ll show you how to do so in a later step of this tutorial). The most important part is to start building your site so any theme will do the job for now. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pick-a-theme.png\" alt=\"pick a theme\" width=\"600\" height=\"276\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218387\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pick-a-theme.png 600w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pick-a-theme-300x138.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll then be asked to choose the name and tagline for your website. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog.jpg\" alt=\"create a new wordpress website\" width=\"775\" height=\"472\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218383\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog-768x468.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>After specifying the details, click <strong>Next</strong>. Bluehost will now install WordPress for you and, once done, will show you a screen like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-installation-successful.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress installation successful\" width=\"775\" height=\"478\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218385\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-installation-successful.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-installation-successful-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-installation-successful-768x474.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can login to your site by appending <strong>wp-admin</strong> to your URL. Here&#8217;s what your WordPress login URL should look like: </p>\n<p>http://example.com/wp-admin</p>\n<p>You can now login to your WordPress website with the credentials sent to your email address. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress login\" width=\"775\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218386\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login-768x437.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.4. Change Your WordPress Theme</h3>\n<p>With WordPress, you can easily change the visual appearance of your website. All you have to do is to find the right WordPress theme and install it on your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>The default WordPress theme is good, but if you want a different look and feel for your site, then you can find an alternative theme from the official theme directory and install it on your site. Finding the perfect theme will enable you to make the site truly yours, and give it that personal &#8220;you&#8221; feeling.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s highly recommended to take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-wordpress-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">top WordPress themes list</a> before you dive in and install a random theme.</p>\n<p>If you choose a premium theme, then it has to be downloaded from the theme vendor’s site and uploaded to your WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you decide to go with a free WordPress theme from the official theme repository, then you can install it directly from your WordPress dashboard without a manual download from your computer.</p>\n<p>To install a free theme, navigate to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Themes</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Then click the <strong>Add New Theme</strong> box.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box.png\" alt=\"add new theme\" width=\"775\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218261\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box-300x178.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box-768x457.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>This will show you some featured themes in your dashboard. Before installing, you can even look at the preview and its details by clicking on the image.</p>\n<p>You can also filter themes based on layouts, features, and your website niche by clicking on the <strong>Feature Filter</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter.jpg\" alt=\"theme feature filter\" width=\"775\" height=\"444\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218257\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter-768x440.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>In the right hand corner, type the theme&#8217;s name in the search bar. Once you’ve found the perfect theme, hover over its image and then click the <strong>Install</strong> button. Next, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to change your website’s appearance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install.png\" alt=\"theme install\" width=\"775\" height=\"416\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218258\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install-300x161.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install-768x412.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.5. Create Your First Page</h3>\n<p>After changing your site’s appearance, it’s time to create a new page on your site.</p>\n<p>In the left-hand menu of your WordPress dashboard, you can find two similar options that&#8217;s often confusing for beginners: <strong>Posts</strong> and <strong>Pages</strong>.</p>\n<p>Choose <strong>Pages</strong> if you want to create standalone pages in your WordPress website such as an About Us page, Contact page, Terms of Service page, etc.</p>\n<p>Choose <strong>Posts</strong> if you want to create a blog post that appears in reverse chronological order (newer ones first) on your WordPress website. Posts are also organized into categories and tags. You can read the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/categories-vs-tags-seo-best-practices-which-one-is-better/\">difference between categories and tags</a> for more information about this.</p>\n<p>To create your first page, head over to your page editor by clicking on <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong>. You will need to add a title for your page before you start writing content in the page editor. To upload images to your website, all you have to do is drag and drop your images to the text editor from your computer. Alternatively, you can use the <strong>Add Media</strong> button to upload your images and videos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-page.png\" alt=\"add new page\" width=\"775\" height=\"372\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218414\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-page.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-page-300x144.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-page-768x369.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.6. Setup a Static Homepage</h3>\n<p>By default, WordPress shows your blog’s latest posts as your homepage instead of a static page. If you want to set a custom page as your homepage, then simply follow the steps below.</p>\n<p>After creating a page, go to <strong>Settings &raquo; Reading</strong> on your WordPress admin dashboard. In the <strong>Your Homepage displays</strong> option, you&#8217;ll need to choose <strong>A static page</strong> and select the page you want to display as your front page in the dropdown menu. Once you&#8217;re done, click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/static-homepage.png\" alt=\"static homepage\" width=\"775\" height=\"471\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218410\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/static-homepage.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/static-homepage-300x182.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/static-homepage-768x467.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.7. Add a Navigation Menu</h3>\n<p>Your navigation menu sticks to the top of your website, so your visitors can easily find the most important pages and links, making it easy to explore your site.</p>\n<p>To add a navigation menu, you need to go to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Menus</strong> in your WordPress admin. Specify a menu name in the <strong>Menu Name</strong> field (this comes in especially handy if your theme supports multiple navigation menus). Then, click <strong>Create Menu</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress-1.jpg\" alt=\"create menu in WordPress\" width=\"775\" height=\"397\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218409\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress-1.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress-1-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress-1-768x393.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can now choose from your existing pages, posts, custom links, and categories. After selecting what you feel deserves to be featured, click <strong>Add to Menu</strong>. With drag and drop, you can position the menu’s structure. Then, you’ll need to specify the display location and click <strong>Save Menu</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1.jpg\" alt=\"position menu structure\" width=\"775\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218407\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1-768x431.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.8. Add and Customize Your Widgets</h3>\n<p>On your WordPress website, you can easily add widgets in your sidebar and other widget-ready locations like your site footer, header, etc.</p>\n<p>Adding a widget allows you to add customized / dynamic content. It allows you to add things like menus, calendars, contact forms, galleries, and other nifty items on your website&#8217;s sidebar or footer area.</p>\n<p>You can add a widget by going to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Widgets</strong> and select from the available widgets. You simply drag and drop your preferred features to the widgetized area of your WordPress site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-widgets-in-wordpress-1.jpg\" alt=\"add widgets in wordpress\" width=\"775\" height=\"417\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218408\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-widgets-in-wordpress-1.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-widgets-in-wordpress-1-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-widgets-in-wordpress-1-768x413.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.9. Customize WordPress with Plugins</h3>\n<p>The beauty of WordPress is that you can easily enhance the capabilities of your site by simply installing the right plugins. Think of plugins as apps for your website (i.e <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-contact-form-plugins/\" title=\"Best WordPress contact form plugins\" target=\"_blank\">contact form</a>, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-gallery-plugins-compared/\" title=\"Best WordPress gallery plugins\" target=\"_blank\">gallery</a>, etc).</p>\n<p>Just like WordPress themes, you can easily find and install free plugins from the WordPress plugins repository within your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is to visit <strong>Plugins &raquo; Add New</strong>. Use the search box in the right-hand corner to find a plugin, and click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button. Once it&#8217;s installed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to get it working. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"install a plugin\" width=\"775\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218371\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin-768x431.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#builder\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 3 &#8211; Choosing a Website Builder</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"#settings\">Chapter 5: Configuring Your Website Settings</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-5-configuring-site-settings.png\" alt=\"chapter 5 configuring site settings\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232329\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-5-configuring-site-settings.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-5-configuring-site-settings-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you’ll want to configure your website settings. Configuring the basic WordPress settings is important to how your site functions. There are a few key website settings you should focus on, we’ll go over those below. </p>\n<h3>5.1. Make Your Site Visible to Google</h3>\n<p>First, you need to make sure your website is visible to Google. This allows your website to be ranked in search engine results, which will allow users to find you on the web easier. </p>\n<p>In the WordPress dashboard, go to <strong>Settings</strong>, then to the <strong>Reading</strong> section. In the Search Engine Visibility section, make sure the box is <em>unchecked</em>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-google-settings.jpg\" alt=\"customize-wordpress-settings\" width=\"740\" height=\"285\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232032\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-google-settings.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-google-settings-300x116.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h3>5.2. Set the Permalink Structure</h3>\n<p>Next, you’ll want to set the permalink structure. A permalink is the web address used to link to your content. By default, WordPress sets the permalink structure, but it’s not the most optimized. Instead, you’ll want a permalink structure that will help search engines and your website visitors easily understand your content. </p>\n<p>So, go to <strong>Settings</strong>, then to <strong>Permalinks</strong>. Under <strong>Common Settings</strong>, select the <strong>Post name</strong> option. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-permalinks.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-permalinks\" width=\"740\" height=\"331\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232033\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-permalinks.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-permalinks-300x134.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h3>5.3. Comments and Notifications</h3>\n<p>If you’re starting a blog or blogging on your website, you’ll also want to configure the comment settings for your website. </p>\n<p>Any blog should allow users to comment on posts, this increases engagement on your website, boosts the time users spend on the page, and encourages to visit your website again. </p>\n<p>To configure the comments, go to <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Discussion</strong>. Here you can choose whether you want to allow people to comment on new articles and allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/discussion-wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-comments-notifications\" width=\"740\" height=\"364\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232034\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/discussion-wordpress.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/discussion-wordpress-300x148.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also decide whether you want commenters to have to fill out their name and email before commenting or be registered and logged in to comment.

WordPress is extremely extensible, so all you have to do is to find the right plugin that allows you to add enhanced capabilities to your site without having to create it yourself or hire a developer.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how easy it is to add enhanced features to your WordPress website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start blogging</li>\n<li>Add an eCommerce storefront</li>\n<li>Add a discussion board/forum</li>\n<li>Make your website available in multiple languages</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>7.1. Start Blogging</h3>\n<p>Adding a blog to your website is a great way to drive traffic to your new website and make it easier for users to discover you online. So, you’ll want to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">start a blog</a> on your new WordPress website. </p>\n<p>First, decide what you’ll blog about. The blog posts you write should match the goal of your website. For example, if you’re starting a small business website for your landscaping company, you could blog about lawn care tips for your customers. If you’re creating an online store, you could blog about gift recommendations to promote your products. Of course, if you’re starting a lifestyle blog, you’ll want to write about lifestyle topics. </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Blog Post</strong><br />\nTo create your first blog post, in the WordPress dashboard, click on <strong>Posts</strong>, and then <strong>Add New</strong>. This will take you to the WordPress editor where you can start writing your post. Simply type in the title of your blog post and start typing the body of the post underneath it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/start-blogging.jpg\" alt=\"start-blogging\" width=\"740\" height=\"332\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232036\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/start-blogging.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/start-blogging-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>In your blog posts, you can add blocks such as images, headings, audio, gallery, quotes, list, video, and more. To add a new block, click on the (+) icon in the top left corner. The most common blocks will appear first. Simply click the block you want to add within your blog post. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/add-blocks.jpg\" alt=\"add-blocks\" width=\"740\" height=\"335\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232037\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/add-blocks.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/add-blocks-300x136.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Add Categories and Tags</strong><br />\nWhen creating a blog post you’ll also want to add categories and tags. Categories and tags will keep the blog content on your website organized and make it easy for your site visitors to find what they’re looking for. </p>\n<p>Categories are meant to be broad groupings. For instance, on a recipe blog, you might have broad categories such as Breakfast Recipes, Lunch Recipes, Dinner Recipes, and Dessert Recipes. </p>\n<p>To add a category to your blog post, go to the gear panel on the right hand side. Under the <strong>Categories</strong> section, click <strong>Add New Category</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/categories-wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-blog-categories\" width=\"740\" height=\"385\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232039\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/categories-wordpress.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/categories-wordpress-300x156.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Name the category in the text field provided and click the <strong>Add New Category</strong> button underneath. Once your new category is created, it will appear with a blue checked box. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/add-categories-2.jpg\" alt=\"add-categories\" width=\"740\" height=\"348\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232038\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/add-categories-2.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/add-categories-2-300x141.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can add as many categories and subcategories as you want. </p>\n<p>Tags are meant to describe specific details of your post and can be used to micro-categorize your posts. For instance, a blog post for a spaghetti recipe could be in the category “Dinner Recipes” and include tags like “spaghetti recipe” and “homemade pasta”. </p>\n<p>To add a tag, go to the panel on the right side of the WordPress editor. Under the <strong>Tags</strong> section, type in your tag and press enter to add a tag to your post. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tags-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"blog-post-tags\" width=\"740\" height=\"405\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232040\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tags-blog-post.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tags-blog-post-300x164.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Once you’re finished writing your blog post and adding categories and tags, click the blue <strong>Publish</strong> button in the top right hand corner to make your blog post live on your website.</p>\n<h3>7.2. Add an eCommerce Storefront</h3>\n<p>The eCommerce industry is booming and the future of retail is eCommerce. With WordPress, adding an eCommerce storefront to your site is as easy as installing a plugin.</p>\n<p>While you can find dozens of eCommerce plugins, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WooCommerce</a> beats the pants off all the competition and stays ahead of the curve with its unique features and ease of use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woocommerce-website.jpg\" alt=\"woocommerce-ecommerce\" width=\"740\" height=\"334\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232044\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woocommerce-website.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woocommerce-website-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce is the best eCommerce plugin for WordPress.

Add a Discussion Board/Forum</h3>\n<p>Adding a discussion board or forum inside your WordPress-powered site is helpful to grow an engaged community. WordPress makes it easy to provide threaded discussion forums where your users can mingle and collaboratively work with a larger public.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bbpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bbPress</a> is one of the best WordPress forums plugins, and is created by the same folks behind WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bbpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bbpress.jpg\" alt=\"bbpress\" width=\"740\" height=\"356\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232042\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bbpress.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bbpress-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bbpress-330x160.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Some of the cool benefits of powering your website with bbPress forums are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hundreds of addon plugins are available that let you easily enhance your forum.</li>\n<li>Makes it easy to get your forums up and running with just a few clicks.</li>\n<li>Comes with a full set of features including extended profiles, group forums, notifications and activity logging, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-plugins/bbpress/\" target=\"_blank\">complete bbPress review</a>. </p>\n<p>Looking to integrate a discussion board/forum with your site? <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get started with bbPress today</a>.</p>\n<h3>7.4. Make Your Website Available in Multiple Languages</h3>\n<p>Want to reach a wider audience by making your website available in multiple languages? Creating a multilingual website and reaching a global audience is easy with WordPress thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-translation-plugins-compared/\" title=\"Best WordPress translation plugins\" target=\"_blank\">different types of translation plugins</a> available in the market.</p>\n<p>With WordPress, you can find tons of different plugins that make it simple to create a multilingual website.</p>\n<p>While some plugins focus on ease of use and enable you to easily create and manage your multilingual website, other plugins help you deliver automated translation based on users’ preferences. You can also find plugins that help you<br />\n connect with professional translators from within your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>To create a multilingual website with ease, we recommend using <a href=\"https://polylang.pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polylang</a>, one of the most popular WordPress translation plugins in the plugin directory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://polylang.pro/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/polylang.jpg\" alt=\"polylang\" width=\"740\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232043\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/polylang.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/polylang-300x136.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With Polylang, you can use as many languages as you want, which is search engine friendly and is also compatible with the WooCommerce plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://polylang.pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get started with Polylang today</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#plugins\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 6 &#8211; Essential WordPress Plugins &#038; Tutorials</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"promote\">Chapter 8: Promote and Grow Your Website</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-8-promote-your-site.png\" alt=\"chapter 8 promote site\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232322\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-8-promote-your-site.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-8-promote-your-site-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Before you start investing time and resources in promoting your site, it’s worth taking a moment to examine whether your website provides value to your visitors. No matter how much you spend on website promotion, your visitors won’t stick around unless it provides some kind of value.</p>\n<p>For example, if your site is an online store, then you might want to publish useful videos demonstrating your products and how to use them. You can also offer huge discounts for first-time customers and bundled purchases.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you have a content website, then you might create pillar content that ranks well on Google so that it attracts new visitors and backlinks.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve built a system on your website, like pillar content that provides some kind of value to your visitors, you can start investing your time and resources to drive traffic.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that without these systems your visitors won’t stick around, making your marketing efforts less effective.</p>\n<h3>8.1. Drive Traffic to Your Website</h3>\n<p>Traffic is the life of every website and, without it, your website will be worthless. </p>\n<p>A few different ways to drive traffic to your blog are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guest posting</strong>: Publish your guest articles in a popular blog and include a backlink to your site. Aside from driving traffic, it helps you demonstrate your expertise in your niche and establish yourself as an authority. </li>\n<li><strong>Email outreach</strong>: Create a list of bloggers in your niche circles. Start an email outreach campaign to reach out to the bloggers and request them to provide a backlink to your site. With the right strategies, this tactic is effective in building backlinks and driving traffic.</li>\n<li><strong>Search engine optimization (SEO)</strong>: SEO enables you to grow your website traffic by getting your blog posts to rank higher in search engines. With onsite and offsite SEO tactics, you can drive more targeted organic traffic to your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Social media</strong>: Encourage your readers to share your blog posts to social media. This can help you drive social media users to your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8.2. More Ways to Promote Your Website</h3>\n<p>Promotional strategies aren’t limited to driving instant traffic. If you’re only focused on short-term gains, chances are you’ll fall behind soon. </p>\n<p>Wondering what promotional strategies you can rely upon for the long-term? Let’s take a look at some of them below. </p>\n<p><strong>1. Start an Email List</strong>: </p>\n<p>One of the best ways to keep your visitors close with your brand or website is by creating an email list. In fact, it’s been found that 70% of first-time visitors will never return to your site once they leave. However, with an email list, you can build a connection with your visitors by regularly updating them on what’s been happening around your website and, ultimately, bring them back to your site.</p>\n<p>You can sign up for a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-email-marketing-services-compared/\" title=\"Best email marketing services\" target=\"_blank\">list building tool</a> like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/constant-contact/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Constant Contact\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constant Contact</a>, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/aweber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">AWeber</a> or <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/mailchimp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">MailChimp</a> and start growing your email list by adding a signup box to your blog. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Exponentially Grow Your List</strong>: </p>\n<p>Most default signup forms you create from email marketing services are boring. This makes lead generation less effective, which also significantly slows down the growth of your email list. </p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a>, you can create beautiful optin forms with ease that are proven to drive more signups. It also comes with dozens of targeting options, so you can display the form to the right user in the right location of your site at the right time without frustrating them.</p>\n<p>OptinMonster also helps you reduce cart abandonment with time-sensitive behavior based offers, which can be super helpful for online retailers.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Acquire Leads and Customers</strong>: </p>\n<p>Investing in online ads is one of the best ways to acquire visitors, leads, and customers. Unlike traditional ads, online ads help you laser target your potential customers. Because of this, you can spend your advertising budget efficiently and drive more revenue through it. </p>\n<p><strong>Facebook ads</strong>: Facebook advertising is probably the easiest, yet effective enough to drive your targeted customers to your websites. It comes with tons of targeting options that enable you to display your ads to the right segment of Facebook audiences that are more likely to become your customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Google AdWords</strong>: When done right, Google AdWords is the most reliable advertising method that helps you generate more leads and customers for your online business. You can place your ads just above Google search results to attract visitors to your site and sell your products.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#features\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 7 &#8211; Add Enhanced Features to Your Website</a></p>\n<h2>Chapter 9: Before-Launch Checklist</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-9-before-launch-checklist.png\" alt=\"chapter 9 before launch checklist\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232323\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-9-before-launch-checklist.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chapter-9-before-launch-checklist-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Making a website is serious business.

This is why we’ve compiled a list of most frequently asked questions, so you can easily get your website up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I create a website without WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, there are a lot of different website builders out there that help you build a website. However, we always recommend you to start a website with WordPress because most free website builders display their ads on your free website, making it look unprofessional. They also don’t even allow you to choose a custom domain name for your site unless you subscribe to a premium plan. Also, if you violate any of their terms, they can shut down your website without warning.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with WordPress, you get full freedom over your site. Plus, you can add any additional functionalities without hiring a developer (like contact forms, an online store, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Can I make a website on WordPress with no coding?</strong></p>\n<p>With WordPress, anyone can create a website without any technical knowledge. You can easily choose from tons of different WordPress themes that help you change your websites’ appearance. WordPress also has several <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-page-builders-compared/\" title=\"Best WordPress page builders\" target=\"_blank\">drag &#038; drop page builders</a> like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/beaver-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Beaver Builder\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beaver Builder</a> and <a title=\"Divi\" href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/divi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" >Divi</a> that makes it super easy for you to create completely custom websites.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org (self-hosted WordPress)?</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress.com is a free blogging platform that lets you kick start a website with ease. However, it comes with a lot of restrictions such as limited theme availability and limited storage space. Plus, the free platform doesn’t allow you to monetize your website with third-party vendors (like Google AdSense).</p>\n<p>WordPress.org, also known as self-hosted WordPress, requires you to own a domain name and a hosting account to run a site. With a self-hosted platform, you get full control over your site, can monetize it the way you want, and it  provides unlimited theme and customization options as well as unlimited storage space depending on your hosting provider.</p>\n<p><strong>How much does it cost to start a website?</strong></p>\n<p>To start a website on self-hosted WordPress, you’ll have to purchase a domain name for $14.99 per year and a hosting account, which costs around $7.99 per month. Altogether, starting a site will cost as low as $110.87 annually.</p>\n<p>You can find thousands of free themes and plugins for your site. However, if you prefer premium themes and plugins, the running cost of your website may increase.</p>\n<p><strong>How to make a website mobile responsive?</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a responsive theme for your website is the easiest way to make your website mobile responsive so that it works on any devices including desktops, mobile phones, and tablets.</p>\n<p><strong>How to make a website Google searchable?</strong></p>\n<p>If you want your potential users to discover your site on Google, then you’ll need to improve your SEO (search engine optimization). SEO is the practice of increasing your website traffic from search engines by getting your web pages to rank higher in search engine results.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I start a site anonymously?</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to publicize a site but remain anonymous, then make sure to protect your domain with WHOIS privacy turned on. For anonymous sites, people usually use a pseudonym/nickname to write under. You can even create a unique email just for managing the site.</p>\n<p><strong>How do websites make money?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of different ways to monetize your website and make money through it. Some of them are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Sell ad spaces to potential advertisers directly or through a third-party vendor like Google AdSense.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-plugins-for-affiliate-marketers/\" target=\"_blank\">Affiliate marketing</a></strong>: Promote products on your website and start generating revenue when your visitors purchase products through your affiliate links.</li>\n<li><strong>Product sales</strong>: Add a storefront to your website and start selling your products to your site visitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Sell services</strong>: Offer a service to your clients and generate revenue through it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can I add a blog to my website?</strong></p>\n<p>With WordPress, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\" target=\"_blank\">adding a blog</a> to your website is easy. All you have to do is to create articles by navigating to <strong>Posts &raquo; Add New</strong>, and publish them by clicking the <strong>Publish</strong> button.</p>\n<p>In addition, make sure to add a link to your blog in your navigation menu so your visitors can easily discover it.</p>\n<p><strong>Can a website be managed by many users?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. WordPress comes with 5 default user roles by which you can manage the roles and permissions for every user of your site: administrator, editor, author, contributor, and subscriber.</p>\n<p><strong>What are categories and tags in WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>The content of your WordPress blog is organized by categories and tags. </p>\n<p>Categories are basically a broad grouping of your blog posts. Think of it as general topics you cover or a table of contents for your blog. Since categories are hierarchical, you can have as many subcategories as you like. </p>\n<p>Tags are meant to describe specific details of your post. They can be used to micro-categorize your content, and they&#8217;re not hierarchical. Think of these as the index part of a book.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I learn more about WordPress terminologies?</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to this <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Glossary Terms for Beginners</a> whenever you&#8217;re puzzled by strange WordPress terms or abbreviations. </p>\n<p><strong>How do I make my website faster?</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a reliable web host like <a title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" >Bluehost</a> is one of the recommended ways to make your website faster.

Plus, what’s the difference between shared vs. VPS vs. dedicated hosting anyway?</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, we’re here to explain web hosting for you. We’ll share with you the differences of each web hosting option: Shared vs. VPS vs. dedicated hosting. After we explain each type of web hosting, you’ll be able to understand which choice is the best for your website. </p>\n<p>Let’s get started. </p>\n<h3>What is Web Hosting?</h3>\n<p>Web hosting is basically where your website is stored on the internet. Web hosting is a service provided by a company that allows people to make their website accessible via the world wide web. </p>\n<p>Simply put, if you build a website on your computer, all of the website files are on your computer and nobody else can see them. But with a web hosting service, your website files get stored in a space on the internet, so anybody can view them. </p>\n<p>This allows people to type your domain name, such as www.IsItWP.com, into the address bar of their browser and instantly get access to you website. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/domain-name-address-bar.jpg\" alt=\"domain-name-hosting-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"370\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232166\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/domain-name-address-bar.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/domain-name-address-bar-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>If you haven’t chosen a domain name for your website yet, check out our post on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/pick-best-domain-name/\">how to pick the best domain name</a>. </p>\n<h3>Why Do You Need Web Hosting?</h3>\n<p>If you’re building a website, you want people to be able to see it. For example, if you <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">start a blog</a> and write your first blog post, without web hosting, no one would be able to read your content. That defeats the whole purpose of starting a blog, doesn’t it? </p>\n<p>But with web hosting, your blog website will have its own spot on the world wide web where users from all over the world can visit your website and read your blog posts. </p>\n<p>Think of your website as a house and web hosting as a street. If your house isn’t on a street and it’s impossible to get to, how will anyone be able to visit you?</p>\n<p>If you want to get visitors to your website, you need web hosting. </p>\n<h3>Does Web Hosting Cost Money?</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/web-hosting-costs.jpg\" alt=\"web-hosting-cost-shared-vs-vps-vs-dedicated\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232167\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/web-hosting-costs.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/web-hosting-costs-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website-expert-answer/\">web hosting does cost money</a>,  it’s one of the necessary costs if you want to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\">make a website</a>. </p>\n<p>A lot of people assume web hosting is expensive, but it’s really not. While there are expensive web hosting options available that cost upwards of $500 per month, there are plenty of cheap, reliable web hosting services out there that only cost $2 to $4 dollars per month. With some of these web hosting options, you even get a free domain name, SSL certificate, and a nearly 100% uptime guarantee. </p>\n<p>That means you can get your website up and running for as little as $2, which is great for people who’re just starting out and need to stick to a tight budget. The best part is, you don’t have to sacrifice quality and reliability when choosing one of the cheaper web hosting options. </p>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/free-web-hosting/\">free web hosting services</a>, but it’s important to note that with free web hosting there is a catch. With free web hosting services, you’ll have to deal with drawbacks such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unwanted Ads</strong> &#8211; Free web hosting services will display unwanted, irrelevant ads on your website, it’s how they make their money. But these ads can annoy your website visitors and make your website look unprofessional.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Traffic</strong> &#8211; Free web hosting services will often limit the amount of traffic you can get to your site, which makes it hard to grow your business. </li>\n<li><strong>You’re Stuck</strong> &#8211; Once you choose a free web hosting service, it’s very difficult to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/switch-one-web-host-another-without-downtime-step-by-step/\">move your website to another web host</a> if you change your mind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With so many affordable web hosting options, it’s better to spend a few dollars rather than choosing free web hosting with all of the downsides they come with. </p>\n<h3>What are the Different Types of Web Hosting</h3>\n<p>There are a number of different types of web hosting but the 3 main solutions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/cheap-hosting-reviews/\">Shared</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/vps/\">VPS</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/dedicated/\" title=\"The Best Dedicated Hosting Companies of 2019 (Pros &#038; Cons)\">Dedicated</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The type of web hosting you choose depends on the type of website you want to build. Are you building a simple business website or blog? Or do you want to start an <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-ecommerce-plugins-compared/\">eCommerce website</a> or a niche social media website that’s constantly updated with new content?</p>\n<p>When choosing a web hosting type you also have to consider the features they offer such as security, performance, if they allow you to easily grow your website, as well as how much work is involved on your end.  </p>\n<p>Of course, you have to look at pricing at the same time as well. The last thing you want to do is spend a bunch of money on a web hosting service that’s not right for your personal needs. </p>\n<p>Next, we’ll go over the differences between shared vs. VPS vs. dedicated hosting, so you can determine which web host option is the best choice for you. </p>\n<h3>Web Hosting Option #1: Shared</h3>\n<p>Shared hosting is exactly what it sounds like. With shared hosting you share the server (space on the internet) with other people. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shared-apartment-complex.jpg\" alt=\"shared-hosting-apartment-complex\" width=\"740\" height=\"493\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232169\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shared-apartment-complex.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shared-apartment-complex-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Shared hosting is like living in an apartment complex. All of the people living in an apartment complex are in the same location and they all have to share resources such as the laundry room, the parking lot, the playground, etc. </p>\n<p>It’s the same concept with shared web hosting. When you host your website with a shared hosting service, your site is stored in the same location as a number of other websites. You have the share the server resources such as memory, disk space, data, and CPU time. </p>\n<p>Most of the time, sharing server resources works out fine. But occasionally, if one of your website neighbors is taking up a lot of resources, it can slow down your website. </p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Affordable</strong> &#8211; Since you’re sharing the server with many other users, you share the cost as well. Which results in a lower price for you. </li>\n<li><strong>Easy Setup</strong> &#8211; Shared hosting services typically take care of the entire setup for you. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sharing the Server</strong> &#8211; One of the main downsides is the fact that you have to share the server with many other websites. </li>\n<li><strong>“Bad Neighbors”</strong> &#8211; Since you share the server with numerous websites, you may have to deal with “bad neighbors” who take up all the resources with high traffic or faulty code. This can affect the speed and performance of your own website. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Web Hosting Option #2: VPS</h3>\n<p>The next web hosting option is VPS. VPS stands for virtual private server. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vps-townhouse.jpg\" alt=\"vps-web-host-townhouse\" width=\"740\" height=\"370\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232170\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vps-townhouse.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vps-townhouse-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>VPS hosting is like living in a townhouse or a condo. You have your own home and are responsible for maintaining it, but you still have to share things on the property. </p>\n<p>With VPS hosting you still have to share the server, but you have to share it with fewer websites than with shared hosting. Plus, you don’t have to share all of the resources. All of the resources are split evenly. This puts a stop to “bad neighbors” using up all the resources because they have a limit they’re not allowed to exceed. Once they go over that resource limit, their website might go down, but your website will be unaffected.  </p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Sharing Resources</strong> &#8211; You don’t have to share all of the resources with many other websites.</li>\n<li><strong>More Powerful</strong> &#8211; VPS hosting is more powerful than shared hosting, it’s more scalable and typically offers better performance and speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> &#8211; VPS hosting is more flexible, allowing you to customize and make changes without affecting other users. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More Expensive</strong> &#8211; VPS is more expensive than shared hosting. </li>\n<li><strong>More Technical</strong> &#8211; With VPS hosting the setup process is more technical, which can be a problem for beginners.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Web Hosting Option #3: Dedicated</h3>\n<p>The final web hosting option is dedicated hosting and just like it sounds, with dedicated hosting you get everything to yourself. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dedicated-house.jpg\" alt=\"dedicated-web-host-house\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-232171\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dedicated-house.jpg 700w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dedicated-house-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>So, dedicated hosting is like owning your own house. You don’t have to share your space with anyone else and you don’t have to share your resources with anyone else either. You don’t even have to deal with any bad neighbors. </p>\n<p>With dedicated hosting, there are no other websites on your hosting and you don’t have to share any resources like CPU time and memory. </p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Bad Neighbors</strong> &#8211; With dedicated web hosting, there are no bad neighbors around for miles and miles who could steal your website resources and negatively affect your <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-caching-plugins-compared/\">website speed and performance</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Control</strong> &#8211; You have full control of the customization of your server. You could even be able to choose the amount and type of your memory as well as other elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Most Expensive</strong> &#8211; Since you get everything to yourself, dedicated hosting is the most expensive web hosting option.</li>\n<li><strong>More Technical</strong> &#8211; With VPS hosting, you need to know a bit more about computers and servers than the average person.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Responsibility</strong> &#8211; With an unmanaged dedicated service you’re responsible for the entire setup, installation, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-security-plugins-compared/\">security</a>, and more. Even with a managed dedicated hosting service, you still have to do a lot of things on your own. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shared vs. VPS vs. Dedicated Hosting: What Should You Choose?</h3>\n<p>So, now that you know the difference between shared vs. VPS vs. dedicated hosting, which one will work best for you and your website?</p>\n<p>Shared hosting is the best option for beginner websites that won’t be getting a ton of traffic, at least at first. When you’re just starting out making a website, you want to stick to a budget and shared hosting will allow you to do that while growing your online presence at the same time. Shared hosting is also a wise choice for static business sites and personal websites, because uptime won’t affect you as much. It’s also a great hosting option for beginners. </p>\n<p>VPS hosting is a better option if you’re expecting your website to get more traffic and can afford to pay a little more. Also, if you start off with a shared hosting service and your <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-seo-tools-to-grow-your-site-traffic/\">website traffic starts to grow quickly</a>, it’s best to upgrade to VPS hosting that offers more resources to handle that traffic. </p>\n<p>Dedicated hosting is the web host option on this list that you’re least likely to need if you&#8217;re a b. You only need all the bells and whistles that a dedicated host provides if you’re handling sensitive transactions and need beefed up security, your website has a large number of high-resolution photos or video streaming, or you want an IP address that you don’t have to share with other websites.  </p>\n<p>Overall, if you’re new to making a website, a shared web host will be your best choice. It’s affordable and will provide you with everything you need to get going. </p>\n<p>Now that you’ve decided which web hosting option is the best for you, how do you choose what web hosting service to go with? </p>\n<p>Well, our top recommendation for web hosting is <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a>.

If you want to build a website or blog, there&#8217;s safety in numbers. The more people who&#8217;re using a particular content management system (CMS), the more likely it is that that CMS is a good option for you too. So, how do you find out what the most popular CMS is?  </p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll share with you the most popular CMS by market share. We&#8217;ll use tools like W3Techs and BuiltWith to determine what CMS comes out on top.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started. </p>\n<h3>What is a Content Management System (CMS)?</h3>\n<p>A content management system (CMS) is a software (most commonly web-based) that allows users to create, manage, and modify content on a website, without needing to know anything about code. </p>\n<p>To put it simply, a content management system makes it easy for anyone to build their own website or blog. Instead of having to build a website from scratch, a CMS handles all of the infrastructures for you. All you have to do is add content to the front-end of your website like copy, images, forms, and so on. </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Live Stats</a>, there are currently 1,676,199,250 (and counting!) websites online right now. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/website-stats.jpg\" alt=\"live-website-stats\" width=\"740\" height=\"436\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231768\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/website-stats.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/website-stats-300x177.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>The reason that number is so high is partly because of content management systems. A content management system allows even beginners to easily make a website in no time.   </p>\n<h3>What is Market Share?</h3>\n<p>Market share is the portion of a market controlled by a particular product or company. In simpler terms, market share shows how many people are using one product over the competition. By looking at market share, we can easily determine what the most popular CMS is. </p>\n<p>For the purposes of this article, market share is determined by the percentages of websites using various content management systems.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s get into the list of the most popular CMS by market share!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1.

This means WordPress is used by 33.5% of all the websites online. That&#8217;s huge!</p>\n<p>WordPress is an open-source software and it&#8217;s free and available to download from the WordPress.org website. All you need to purchase is a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/get-free-domain-off-bluehost-web-hosting/\" title=\"How to Get 65% Off Bluehost Web Hosting &#038; Free Domain Name\">domain name and WordPress hosting</a> in order to run your website and make it available to users online.</p>\n<p>WordPress is beginner-friendly; you can easily <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\">make a website</a>, blog, or online store with this CMS.

As you can see, there&#8217;s a large difference between WordPress at 1st place and Joomla at 2nd place. </p>\n<p>Joomla is also a free and open-sourced software, like WordPress. Downloading Joomla is easy and many hosting providers offer 1-click installations. With Joomla, you can quickly <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">start a blog</a>, business website, community website, and more using their themes and extensions. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">3.

Drupal offers themes and modules to help users design a site but they&#8217;re more difficult to find and install compared to WordPress. In addition, adding content to Drupal is simple but changing the look of your site is more a more complicated process than other content management systems.  </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/shopify/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >4.

This is in part because Squarespace is a page builder with a drag and drop interface, rather than a fully-fledged publishing platform like WordPress. </p>\n<p>They offer modern templates, style editor, free Typekit and Google fonts, customizable content layouts, and more.</p>\n<p>For more info, check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/squarespace-vs-wordpress-which-is-the-best-choice-expert-review/\">Squarespace vs. WordPress</a>.  </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wix/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >6.

Blogger is a blog-publishing service and it&#8217;s totally free. </p>\n<p>Blogger is a great option for beginners or casual bloggers, but not a great option if you want to start a business website. Plus, with Blogger, you don&#8217;t actually own your own blog; Google can delete it at any time. But with a self-hosted WordPress site, you have complete ownership and control. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://typo3.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">10.

TYPO3 is for advanced programmers because it&#8217;s difficult to install and it takes much more time to learn how to use it than WordPress or Joomla, for instance. </p>\n<h3>What is the Best CMS Platform to Start a Website?</h3>\n<p>As you can see from this list of the most popular CMS by market share, WordPress comes out on top by leaps and bounds. With a whopping 60.4% market share, it&#8217;s clear that WordPress is the most popular and best CMS on the market. </p>\n<p>Not only is WordPress the most popular CMS for building websites in general, it&#8217;s by far the most popular choice for creating a blog. According to statistics from BuiltWith, 97% of blogs online are using WordPress. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordpress-popularity-blogs.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-blog-statistics\" width=\"740\" height=\"394\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231794\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordpress-popularity-blogs.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordpress-popularity-blogs-300x160.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Plus, WordPress is popular for a reason. It&#8217;s easy-to-use, even for complete beginners, you have complete control of your website, and there are endless options for customization and adding extra power to your website. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why WordPress is most popular CMS to use for making a website or blog. </p>\n<p>We hope you enjoyed this article on the most popular CMS by market share and that this information helps you choose the best content management system for your needs.

But it is. Every website is at risk of being hacked, from giant eCommerce websites to small, personal websites. </p>\n<p>You might also think that since WordPress is the most popular platform for building websites, your site is totally secure. But that&#8217;s not completely true either. While the WordPress core software is very secure, there are still other steps you need to take to further protect your website. Plus, the sheer popularity of WordPress is partly what attracts these cybercriminals to your website.</p>\n<p>Just take a look at some of these <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/interesting-wordpress-stats-facts/\">WordPress statistics</a> that show how important it is to protect your WordPress website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>83% of all CMS based websites that were hacked in 2017 were running WordPress, which makes sense since WordPress holds 60% of the CMS market share. (WPBeginner)</li>\n<li>Hackers attack WordPress sites both big and small, with over 90,978 attacks happening per minute. (<a href=\"https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress-security-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WPPlugins</a>)</li>\n<li>The four most common WordPress malware infections are Backdoors, Drive-by downloads, Pharma hacks, and Malicious redirects. (<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/four-malware-infections-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smashing Magazine</a>)</li>\n<li>Google blacklists around 20,000 websites for malware, and around 50,000 for phishing, every single week. (WPBeginner)</li>\n<li>Wordfence blocked 3,236,017,356 attacks on WordPress sites in the last 30 days. (<a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wordfence</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see from these statistics, anyone with a WordPress site is at risk of an attack, making it extremely important to beef up the security of your WordPress site. </p>\n<p>A hacked website can cost you a ton of money and damage the reputation of your business. If you&#8217;re selling products online or collecting online payments and sensitive information from your customers, protecting your website should be a top priority. Hackers can steal your customers&#8217; private information, passwords, credit card info, and more. </p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t just have to worry about sensitive information being stolen either. Hackers also commonly take over your website and its content to install malicious software and can even distribute malware to your users too. They might even ask you for ransom money in order to regain access to your own website.  </p>\n<p>Some hackers don&#8217;t even need a reason to attack your website, some of them do it just for the &#8220;fun&#8221; of it. </p>\n<p>Protecting your WordPress website is not something you want to ignore. There are a number of easy steps you can take, even if you&#8217;re not tech savvy, to hack-proof your WordPress website. So, let&#8217;s dive into the 1st easy step in our WordPress security guide. 	</p>\n<h3 id=\"security-plugin\">The Easiest Way to Protect Your Site?

Shared hosting providers like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a> and <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/siteground/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Siteground</a> are always monitoring their network for suspicious activity, so that&#8217;s one less thing for you to worry about. </p>\n<p>Hosting providers like these will also keep their server software and hardware up to date, have tools in place to prevent DDoS attacks, and have plans in place to protect your data in the case an incident does occur. </p>\n<p>Another key security feature that should come with WordPress hosting is an SSL certificate. An SSL certificate helps secure the connection between your website and your visitors which helps keep personal information, eCommerce transactions, and other sensitive data safe. </p>\n<p>We recommend using <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a> for hosting your WordPress site. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer.png\" alt=\"bluehost-wordpress-hosting\" width=\"740\" height=\"404\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228328\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Not only is Bluehost one of the most secure hosting solutions for your WordPress site, but they also have worked out a great deal for IsItWP readers. </p>\n<p>When you sign up with Bluehost you get a free domain, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/get-free-ssl-certificate/\">free SSL certificate</a> to protect your website, and over 60% off of web hosting. So, you can start your website and make sure it&#8217;s secure for only $2.75/month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Get Started with Bluehost Today.</a> </p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want an even more secure hosting provider, you can also choose a managed WordPress hosting service. The only downside to a shared hosting solution like Bluehost is that you have to share the server resources with all of the other customers. This means there&#8217;s a risk that a hacker can use a neighboring website to attack your own website. </p>\n<p>With a managed WordPress hosting service like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wpengine/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >WPEngine</a>, it&#8217;s like getting a security concierge for your WordPress website. Managed WordPress hosting providers do all the work for you. They offer automatic WordPress updates, automatic backups, and more advanced security measures that make it a more secure platform for your site.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"passwords\">Use Strong and Unique Passwords</h3>\n<p>Another super easy way to better protect your website is by using strong and unique passwords. 8% of WordPress security breaches happen as the result of a weak password. Choosing a strong and secure password is a simple change you can make that will protect your website from intruders. </p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;ve got a password like &#8220;ilovesdogs&#8221; or even the dreaded &#8220;12345678&#8221;, change it now. Take a look at the tips below for how to choose a secure password:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make it Longer</strong> &#8211; It only takes 15 minutes for a code-breaking program to figure out an 8-character password. Make your password at least 10 characters long. </li>\n<li><strong>Make it Unique</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t choose common phrases or a word chosen straight out of the dictionary, make your password unique.</li>\n<li><strong>Mix it Up</strong> &#8211; Add special characters, numbers, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. </li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t Use Personal Details</strong> &#8211; Avoid using personal details in your password like your date of birth, Social Security number, or address. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t want to try to come up with a secure password on your own? Try out IsItWp&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/password-generator/\">Free Strong Password Generator Tool</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/password-generator/\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/isitwp-password-generator.jpg\" alt=\"isitwp-password-generator-tool\" width=\"740\" height=\"396\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230854\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/isitwp-password-generator.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/isitwp-password-generator-300x161.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With our password generator tool, you can instantly get a highly secure password for your WordPress admin that no hacker will be able to figure out. You can decide how long you want your password to be, whether you want to include uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters and whether you want a password that&#8217;s easier to remember. </p>\n<p>Simply click on the blue circle to generate a strong password. If you don&#8217;t like the password that&#8217;s generated, click again to get another strong password instantly. </p>\n<p>With this tool, you can easily come up with a password for your WordPress admin that would take hackers more than a lifetime to figure out. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget, once you&#8217;ve got a secure password for your WordPress admin, don&#8217;t use that password for any other account. </p>\n<h3 id=\"username\">Choose a Strong Username for WordPress Admin</h3>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of creating a strong password, you should also choose a strong username for your WordPress admin as well. A strong username is just as important as choosing a strong password. Because of course, if a hacker is trying to break into your website, they need to figure out your password and username. </p>\n<p>A common username WordPress users choose is &#8220;admin&#8221; or their name. If you have a simple username, you&#8217;re making it that much easier for hackers to gain entry to your site. So, you need to create a stronger username. </p>\n<p>Choose a username that&#8217;s not related to the content of your website, don&#8217;t include personal information or details, and make it something that&#8217;s unique to you and would be difficult for other people to guess. </p>\n<p>You can also hide your username from being shown on your website so that hackers can&#8217;t see it. In your WordPress dashboard, go to <strong>Users</strong>, then to <strong>Your Profile</strong>. Go to the <strong>Display name publicly as</strong> field and choose the option to display a nickname instead of your username.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wp-username.jpg\" alt=\"hide-wordpress-username\" width=\"740\" height=\"419\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-230857\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wp-username.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wp-username-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Important Tip</strong>: Don&#8217;t make your username too obscure though. It has to be something you can easily remember because if you forget your password, you&#8217;ll need your username to retrieve it. </p>\n<h3 id=\"practices\">Follow WordPress Plugins &#038; Themes Best Practices</h3>\n<p>One of the perks of using WordPress is having access to thousands of free plugins and <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-responsive-wordpress-themes/\">free WordPress themes</a>. But some of these plugins and themes can actually threaten the security of your website. In fact, almost 50% of WordPress sites are affected by a security vulnerability caused by an outdated or poorly coded WordPress plugin or theme.</p>\n<p>For this reason, you need to be careful about which themes and plugins you choose to download and install on your WordPress site. </p>\n<p>Generally, the best way to choose secure WordPress plugins and themes is to choose the most popular plugins from the WordPress Official Plugin Directory. There&#8217;s safety in numbers. If a lot of people are using a plugin or theme and it has lots of great reviews, it&#8217;s most likely a great plugin that will not open you up to any vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popular-plugins.jpg\" alt=\"popular-wordpress-plugins\" width=\"740\" height=\"444\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231099\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popular-plugins.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popular-plugins-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>If a plugin or theme is rarely updated, has many poor customer reviews, or is lacking support, it&#8217;s probably not a plugin or theme you want to use on your site. </p>\n<p>To easily find out when a plugin was last updated, just go to the plugin&#8217;s page in the WordPress Official Directory. On the top right corner of the page, you can see when the plugin was last updated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plugin-updated.jpg\" alt=\"plugin-last-updated\" width=\"740\" height=\"324\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231100\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plugin-updated.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/plugin-updated-300x131.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /> </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t download any plugin without first doing your research. Make sure the plugins and themes you choose are trusted and secure. </p>\n<h3 id=\"updated\">Keep Your WordPress Site Updated</h3>\n<p>The next step in this WordPress security guide is to keep your WordPress site updated. Keeping your WordPress site updated is important to protect yourself against vulnerabilities. In fact, 39% of hacked WordPress websites were using an outdated version of the software. The reason these plugins and WordPress get regular updates are typically to add security improvements and bug fixes, so you need to stay up-to-date. </p>\n<p>Since WordPress is an open source software, it&#8217;s regularly maintained and updated. While WordPress automatically installs minor updates, for major updates you need to manually initiate the update.</p>\n<p>You also need to keep all of the plugins you&#8217;ve installed along with your WordPress them updated as well. </p>\n<p>Luckily, WordPress makes it easy to keep your site, plugins, and themes updated. In your WordPress dashboard, you&#8217;ll see an <strong>Updates</strong> section. Any time one of your third-party plugins needs an update, you&#8217;ll get a notification for it. Simply click on <strong>Updates</strong> and you&#8217;ll see which plugins need to be updated. You can select each plugin and click on the Update Plugins button to instantly update.   </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordpress-updates.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-updates-wordpress-security-guide\" width=\"740\" height=\"490\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231101\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordpress-updates.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordpress-updates-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>In this area, you can also make sure you&#8217;ve installed all the latest WordPress updates as well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"backup\">Install a WordPress Backup Plugin</h3>\n<p>In the instance that your website gets infected with viruses or malware or your site becomes compromised by a hacker, it&#8217;s important that your site is backed up. Ideally, you&#8217;ll want a complete backup of your entire website including your database and all of your WordPress files. This might seem like a time-consuming and tricky project but luckily, there are a number of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared/\">awesome WordPress backup plugins</a> that will do all of the work for you. </p>\n<p>Here are a few of our picks for the best backup plugins to secure and back up your WordPress website:</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/updraftplus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >1.

VaultPress by Jetpack</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://vaultpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vaultpress.jpg\" alt=\"vaultpress-backup-plugin\" width=\"740\" height=\"302\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231104\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vaultpress.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vaultpress-300x122.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>VaultPress by Jetpack, which comes from Automattic (the team behind <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-one-really-better/\">WordPress.com</a>), is one of the most powerful backup and security plugins available. </p>\n<p>This plugin makes it easy to keep an up-to-date backup of your entire site with both daily and real-time syncing of all your WordPress content.

By default, WordPress allows users to attempt to log in as many times as they want. This isn&#8217;t ideal if you want to prevent hackers from trying to figure out your password and entering your website. So, limit login attempts to prevent brute force password discovery.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a security plugin with a web app firewall as we recommended above, this is covered for you by your security plugin. But if not, you&#8217;re going to want to download a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Login LockDown</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/login-lockdown.jpg\" alt=\"login-lockdown-wordpress-security-guide\" width=\"740\" height=\"342\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231234\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/login-lockdown.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/login-lockdown-300x139.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Login LockDown records the IP address and timestamp of every failed login attempt. If more than a certain number of attempts are detected within a short period of time from the same IP range, then the login function is disabled for all requests from that IP range. </p>\n<p>In the settings for the plugin, you can choose the max login retries, retry time period restriction, the lockout length, and more. </p>\n<h3 id=\"questions\">Add Security Questions to WordPress Login </h3>\n<p>Another way to beef up the security of your WordPress Login is to add security questions. Security questions act like extra passwords for your WordPress login, making it even harder for intruders to gain access to your site.</p>\n<p>You can add security questions to your WordPress login by using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-questions/#description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WP Security Question</a>. With this plugin, you can set a security question of your choice for WordPress login, forgot password screens, and registrations.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to protect the other forms on your website as well. For instance, if you want to create contact forms, guest post submission forms, order forms, and more for your website, you need to make sure those forms are secure too. Hackers can use your forms to expose vulnerabilities and gain access to your website, so it&#8217;s important to use secure forms. </p>\n<p>When using a secure form builder such as <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a>, your forms will already be secure, but you can add extra layers of security to your forms as well. </p>\n<p>With WPForms, you can customize your form field inputs. This way a hacker can&#8217;t enter random letters and numbers to try and get access to your website, they can only enter the data you want to be entered. </p>\n<p>You can also enable reCAPTCHA on your forms. This forces all site visitor submitting a form on your site to click the &#8220;I&#8217;m not a robot&#8221; checkbox before submitting. This feature will help fight form spam and it can also prevent your site&#8217;s comments and forums from being broken into and hit with tons of spam comments.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/reCAPTCHA-Example.jpg\" alt=\"recaptcha-form-security\" width=\"520\" height=\"499\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231249\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/reCAPTCHA-Example.jpg 520w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/reCAPTCHA-Example-300x288.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" /> </p>\n<p>WPForms also offers a Custom CAPTCHA addon that allows you to customize the questions and answers as CAPTCHA on your forms. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Started with WPForms Today.</a> </p>\n<h3 id=\"idle\">Log Out Idle Users Automatically</h3>\n<p>Did you know that when users leave their screens unattended (like leaving your website open and walking away from their computer) it&#8217;s actually a security risk for your website? When a user wanders away from their screen, intruders can take over their session, change their password, or change other sensitive account information. To prevent this from happening, install a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/inactive-logout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inactive Logout</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/inactive-logout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/inactive-logout.jpg\" alt=\"inactive-logout-ultimate-wordpress-security-guide\" width=\"740\" height=\"425\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231235\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/inactive-logout.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/inactive-logout-300x172.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed and activated the plugin, you can head to <strong>Settings</strong> to configure the plugin settings. Here you can decide how long in minutes users are allowed to idle before they get logged out and you can choose what message they&#8217;ll see upon logout as well.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"editing\">Disable File Editing on Your Site</h3>\n<p>If an intruder happens to get access to your website, they can easily edit the PHP files of plugins and themes inside of the WordPress admin interface. Because of the security risk this poses, we suggest that you turn this feature off. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve downloaded the security plugin <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/sucuri/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Sucuri</a> that we recommended earlier, you can do this easily with their Hardening feature. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can turn this feature off by adding a small piece of code to your site. In the wp-config.php file add the following code:<br />\n<code><br />\n// Disallow file edit<br />\ndefine( \'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT\', true );<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Click here for for detailed instructions on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-edit-wp-config-php-file-in-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">how to edit wp-config.phph file in WordPress</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"signs\">Signs Your WordPress Site Has Been Hacked</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to WordPress and building websites, you might be wondering how you can even tell that your WordPress site has been hacked. It&#8217;s important to recognize that your site has been hacked as soon as possible. Because the longer the hackers have access to your site without you noticing, the more damage they can do. </p>\n<p>So, be on the lookout and check out this list of signs that your WordPress site has been hacked: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unable to Login to WordPress Admin</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re unable to log into your WordPress admin, and you know it&#8217;s not because you forgot your password, it&#8217;s a sign that an intruder has gained access to your site and changed your login details. </li>\n<li><strong>Website Slow or Unresponsive</strong> &#8211; If your website is taking longer than usual to load or it&#8217;s unresponsive, it&#8217;s a good possibility your website has been hacked. This can happen when a hacker adds a piece of code to your website or an attack known as Denial of Service. </li>\n<li><strong>Defaced Homepage</strong> &#8211; If your website homepage changes in appearance or displays a message from the hacker, it&#8217;s a clear sign you&#8217;ve been hacked. </li>\n<li><strong>Sudden Drop in Traffic</strong> &#8211; Hackers can redirect traffic away from your website, so if you see a sudden, drastic dip in your website traffic, you may have been hacked. </li>\n<li><strong>Unwanted Popups or Ads</strong> &#8211; If you see unwanted popups or ads on your website that you haven&#8217;t placed there, you&#8217;ve been hacked by intruders who&#8217;re trying to send your website traffic to a spammy or illegal website. </li>\n<li><strong>Suspicious User Accounts</strong> &#8211; Seeing suspicious user accounts in WordPress is another sign you&#8217;ve been hacked. If your site has open registration and no spam protection, many spam accounts can be created, which is not a big deal. But if you don&#8217;t have open registration and you find suspicious user accounts with administrator privileges, it&#8217;s a sign you&#8217;ve been hacked. </li>\n<li><strong>Unusual Activity in Server Logs</strong> &#8211; Server logs are simple text files that keep a log of the various activities that are taking place on your website. You can check these logs in your WordPress dashboards under <strong>Statistics</strong>. If you find unusual activity in your logs, it could be because you&#8217;ve been hacked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a security plugin that will watch out for suspicious activity for you, you need to be vigilant when looking out for the signs of being hacked. The sooner you catch an intruder, the sooner you can make your website safe again. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use our <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-website-security-scanner/\">Free WordPress Website Security Scanner</a> to check your website for any known malware or website errors. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-website-security-scanner/\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/isitwp-website-scanner.jpg\" alt=\"isitwp-website-security-scanner\" width=\"740\" height=\"297\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-231248\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/isitwp-website-scanner.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/isitwp-website-scanner-300x120.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With our free tool that&#8217;s powered by Sucuri, all you have to do is enter the URL of your website and the tool instantly scans your site for any potential vulnerabilities. When the scanning is finished, you&#8217;ll get a complete report on the health and safety of your website.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"hacked\">What to Do if Your Site Has Been Hacked</h3>\n<p>If you see any of the signs above on your WordPress website, you&#8217;ll probably start to panic. If your website has never been hacked before, it&#8217;s hard to know what the next step you should take is. But don&#8217;t worry, you can get your website back. </p>\n<p>The first step to fixing a hacked website is to identify the problem area. Use the criteria in the previous section to figure out where the hack is coming from. For instance, are you unable to login to the WordPress admin? Or is your site redirecting users to a different website? You&#8217;ll need to know what the problem is in order to fix it. </p>\n<p>Next, contact your hosting company. Most hosting companies have experience in dealing with this type of situation, so they should be able to help guide you in fixing the issue. They may even be able to give you some extra information about how the hacker gained access to your site so you can prevent it from happening again in the future. Your hosting company should be able to help solve the issue altogether as well, but if not, you have other places you can turn to as well. </p>\n<p>Now, if your hosting company can fix your hacked website, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re all alone. You can turn to a service that offers to fix hacked websites like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/sucuri/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Sucuri</a>, the plugin we mentioned earlier. Not only does Sucuri protect your website from potential attacks, but if your site gets hacked they can fix it too. </p>\n<p>You can choose your pricing plan based on how fast you want their response time to be, the fasted guaranteed response time being 4 hours. Once your website is fixed, you&#8217;ll receive a full report. </p>\n<p>We hope this ultimate WordPress security guide helped you learn how to protect your website from all types of attackers and intruders.

Initially, it was used by individuals for sharing their personal thoughts and opinions. Now even <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/popular-big-name-brands-using-wordpress/\" title=\"46 Biggest Brands in the World Using WordPress Actively\">businesses around the globe</a> leverage blogs for expanding their reach and to generate new leads.</p>\n<p>When it comes to blogging, having a purpose is critical, or you’ll lose the direction and inspiration as time passes. When you blog with a purpose, your readers will connect with it because that purpose shines through in your writing.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the reasons why people blog:</p>\n<p><strong>Journal/Personal Blogging</strong></p>\n<p>Some people blog to document everything they have going on, so they can keep track of their progress. It helps you connect with like-minded people in the community and build long-lasting relationships with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Make Money Blogging</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of people start a blog with a single goal: to make money online.</p>\n<p>Your blog can be your semi-passive income source, meaning you can earn money even when you’re not actively updating it. Some of the ways you can monetize your blog are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Sell ad space on your blog and generate a steady stream of income from it.</li>\n<li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong>: Refer products to your audience and generate revenue when they purchase using your referral links.</li>\n<li><strong>Sell products</strong>: Create a product that you know your audience will love and sell it on your blog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Establish Yourself as an Authority</strong></p>\n<p>In this crowded digital era, blogging can help you demonstrate your expertise and establish you as an authority. In order to do this, you’ll have to keep an eye on trends in your niche and consistently blog about it. </p>\n<p>Be sure to offer tips and recommendations to your audience on a regular basis so they&#8217;ll realize your blog is a go-to resource when it comes to everything related to your niche.</p>\n<h3>1.1. Choose the Right Niche for Your Blog</h3>\n<p>When starting a blog, it’s imperative to realize that blogging isn’t always going to be rainbows and unicorns. Blogging is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>\n<p>To run a blog on a long-term basis, you’ll need to be persistent. And to be persistent, you’ll need to consider a few different things when choosing a topic for your blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Passion</strong>: For persistent blogging, you&#8217;ll need to choose a topic that you’re really passionate about. You can’t continuously write about a topic that doesn&#8217;t excite you.</li>\n<li><strong>Traffic volume</strong>: Just because you love a topic doesn’t always mean it’s the best one for starting a blog. If no one else wants to read a blog on the topic you’re about to choose, then you’ll need to reconsider the topic before jumping in.</li>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Consider the purpose of your blog when you decide on a topic. For instance, if you want to make a living from advertising, but the niche is too narrow with low traffic volume, then you might want to expand your niche or change your monetization strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.2. Unlearn Conventional Writing Lessons</h3>\n<p>Blogging is a bit different from conventional writing. If you’re an aspiring blogger, then you might have to unlearn a few things that you were taught in your English classes.</p>\n<p>For example, when you’re blogging or writing for the web, it’s advised to craft short sentences and even shorter paragraphs, so readers can quickly consume your article. This is mainly because people have shorter attention spans on the web.</p>\n<p>Another difference is that print editors often recommend writers write in third person. However, bloggers are expected to write in a first person voice. By writing in a first person voice, you’re talking directly to your readers just like you would with your friends.</p>\n<p>Aside from talking to your readers directly, you’ll also have to optimize your blog posts for search engines. This&#8217;ll help search engines discover and index your website, so you can attract more search engine traffic, also known as organic traffic, to your blog.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"blogging-platform\">Chapter 2: Choosing a Blogging Platform</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-2-choose-a-blogging-platform.png\" alt=\"chapter 2 choose a blogging platform\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224459\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-2-choose-a-blogging-platform.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-2-choose-a-blogging-platform-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>The blogging platform you choose can make or break your blog.</p>\n<p>Not every blogging platform is created equal. It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the different blogging platforms available. So, before you jump in, it’s worth taking a moment to examine a few different factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your blogging purpose</strong>: When choosing a platform, it’s essential for you to check if it aligns with your blogging goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Usability</strong>: Obviously, you’ll need to choose a platform that’s easy to use. With an intuitive platform, you can easily get things done with minimal learning curve.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetization</strong>: Double-check if your blogging platform of choice allows you to monetize your blog with ads. For instance, some platforms, like the free WordPress.com, don’t allow you to monetize your blog. That means such a platform isn’t a good fit for you if your goal is to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/legit-ways-to-make-money-online-blogging/\">make money blogging</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.1. Best Blogging Platforms Showdown</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what factors you’ll need to consider, let’s take a look at different blogging platforms in existence.</p>\n<p><strong>WordPress.org</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wordpress.png\" alt=\"wordpress.org\" width=\"746\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-219889\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wordpress.png 746w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wordpress-300x141.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" /></p>\n<p>Without a doubt, WordPress is the most popular blogging platform out there.

Why Do We Recommend WordPress.org?</h3>\n<p>We recommend using the self-hosted WordPress.org platform to everyone because it&#8217;s a truly superior blogging platform.

It’s what your customers type in their browsers to access your website. A domain name normally costs around $14.99 per year.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at a few different approaches you can follow to choose a domain name for your blog.</p>\n<p><strong> Go for a Brandable Domain Name</strong></p>\n<p>Gone are the days when you can boost your blog’s search rankings with a keyword stuffed domain name. While including a keyword in your domain name can still have a positive impact, stuffing with keywords could negatively impact your SEO efforts.</p>\n<p>When choosing a domain name, it’s advised to go for brandable domain name, like ProBlogger.com or OptinMonster.com over keyword-stuffed one, such as copywritingtweaks.com or killercopywriting.com.</p>\n<p>Not only are they easier to remember, but it helps you get positive SEO impact in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong> Choose the Right Domain Extension</strong></p>\n<p>.com domains are so popular that people are more likely to type in [yourblog].com on their browser to visit your site. In fact, if you choose a different extension, then you might want to do extra work to get people to remember it.</p>\n<p>Of course, we always recommend choosing a .com domain name for your blog. However, if .com isn’t available, you can go for .net or .org.</p>\n<p><strong> Use a Domain Name Generator</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/domainnamegenerator.png\" alt=\"Domain Name Generator by IsItWP\" width=\"775\" height=\"423\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-222529\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/domainnamegenerator.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/domainnamegenerator-300x164.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/domainnamegenerator-768x419.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Choosing a perfect domain name for your blog can be intimidating because it’s highly likely that your first domain name of choice’s already taken. That means you’ll need to brainstorm domain name ideas and check for its availability one-by one.</p>\n<p>A domain name generator helps you save time by automatically generating tons of domain name ideas by simply entering one or two keywords.</p>\n<p>You can choose <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/domain-name-generator/\">IsItWP’s domain name generator</a> for finding the perfect domain name.</p>\n<h3>3.2. How to Set Up Domain Name and Web Hosting</h3>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve found a domain name, the next thing you’ll need to do is register it and set up web hosting.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to the web space, below is the definition of a domain name and <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-wordpress-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\">web hosting</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain name</strong>: Your domain name is your blog’s address on the internet, like Google.com or IsItWP.com. It’s what your customers type in their browsers to access your website. A domain name normally costs around $14.99 per year, but we&#8217;ll show you how to get one for free later in this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Web hosting</strong>: Your web hosting account is where your blog’s content and files are stored. Think of it as your website&#8217;s house. When a visitor tries to access your blog by typing your web address (domain name), they&#8217;ll be directed to the website files stored in your web hosting server. Web hosting typically costs $7.99 per month.</p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re first starting your blog, the combined cost of a domain name and hosting can seem like quite a lot.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve worked out a deal with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> to offer our users a free domain name, free SSL, and over 60% off on WordPress hosting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"btn ltgreen light\">Click here to Claim this Exclusive Bluehost Offer &raquo;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> is one of the largest hosting companies in the world.

After that, you’ll receive an email with details on how to log into your web hosting control panel (cPanel) where you can manage everything from hosting files to emails and support.</p>\n<h3>3.3. How to Install WordPress on Your Web Host</h3>\n<p>With Bluehost, you don&#8217;t have to go through a separate WordPress installation process because Bluehost now does it by default. All you have to do is choose your WordPress theme, then specify the name and tagline for your blog, and you&#8217;ll be ready to get started with WordPress. </p>\n<p>After subscribing to your hosting plan, you&#8217;ll now be prompted to choose a WordPress theme. You can pick just about anything during this step because you can always change your theme later (we’ll show you how to do this in a later step of this tutorial). The most important part is to start building your blog, so go ahead and choose any theme that catches your eye just to get you rolling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pick-a-theme.png\" alt=\"pick a theme\" width=\"600\" height=\"276\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218387\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pick-a-theme.png 600w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pick-a-theme-300x138.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll then be asked to choose the name and tagline for your blog. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog.jpg\" alt=\"create a new wordpress blog\" width=\"775\" height=\"472\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218383\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-a-new-wordpress-blog-768x468.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>After specifying the details, click <strong>Next</strong>.

Here&#8217;s what your WordPress login URL should look like: </p>\n<p>http://example.com/wp-admin</p>\n<p>You can now log into your WordPress blog with the credentials sent to your email address. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress login\" width=\"775\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218386\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wordpress-login-768x437.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>3.4. How to Install a WordPress Theme</h3>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve logged into WordPress, changing the visual appearance of your blog is easy. All you have to do is find the right WordPress theme and install it on your WordPress blog.</p>\n<p>The default WordPress theme is good, but if you want a different look and feel for your site, then you can find an alternative theme from the official theme directory and install it on your site.</p>\n<p>But before you choose a random free theme for your blog, take a look at our list of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-wordpress-themes/\">top WordPress themes</a> and decide which one would be the best choice.</p>\n<p>If you choose a premium theme, then it has to be downloaded from the theme vendor’s site and uploaded to your WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you decide to go with a free WordPress theme from the official theme repository, then you can search and install it directly from your WordPress dashboard without having to download it to your computer.</p>\n<p>To install a free theme, navigate to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Themes</strong> in your WordPress dashboard. Then click the <strong>Add New Theme</strong> box.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box.png\" alt=\"add new theme\" width=\"775\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218261\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box-300x178.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-new-theme-box-768x457.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You will see some featured themes in your dashboard. Before installing a theme, you can preview it by clicking on the thumbnails displayed.</p>\n<p>You can also filter themes based on layouts, features, and blog niches by clicking on the <strong>Feature Filter</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter.jpg\" alt=\"theme feature filter\" width=\"775\" height=\"444\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218257\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-feature-filter-768x440.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>In the right-hand corner, type the theme name in the search bar. Once you’ve found the right theme, hover on its image and then click the <strong>Install</strong> button. Next, you need to click <strong>Activate</strong> to change your blog’s appearance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install.png\" alt=\"theme install\" width=\"775\" height=\"416\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218258\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install-300x161.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/theme-install-768x412.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>3.5. How to Install a WordPress Plugin</h3>\n<p>Now that you’ve installed a WordPress theme, you probably want to know how to enhance your blog by adding features like a contact form, photo gallery, etc.</p>\n<p>With WordPress, you can find thousands of free plugins (apps) that let you easily add additional features to your blog without having to touch a single line of code. Just like WordPress themes, you can easily find and install free plugins from the WordPress plugin repository within your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is to visit the <strong>Plugins &raquo; Add New</strong> page and use the search box in the right-hand corner to find a plugin. Once you find the plugin you’re looking for, click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and then click <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"install a plugin\" width=\"775\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218371\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/install-a-plugin-768x431.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#blogging-platform\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 2 &#8211; Choosing a Blogging Platform</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"blog-settings\">Chapter 4: Configuring Your Blog Settings</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-4-configuring-blog-settings.png\" alt=\"chapter 4 configuring blog settings\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224461\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-4-configuring-blog-settings.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-4-configuring-blog-settings-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>By now, you’ve had your basic blog setup.</p>\n<p>You already know how to change a WordPress theme and install plugins. So far so good.</p>\n<p>Before you jump in and start publishing articles on your blog, you’ll need to change some default blog settings and adjust them to your preferences. Let’s take a look…</p>\n<h3>4.1. Choose Your Permalink Structure</h3>\n<p>In WordPress, permalink is the web address / URL of the content you publish on your site. It’s what people enter into their browser address bar to visit the web pages of your site.</p>\n<p>The wrong permalink choice can hurt your search engine traffic and referral traffic, so it’s essential for you to choose the right one when setting up your site.</p>\n<p>The default permalink structure known as <strong>Plain</strong> contains some random numbers in your URL, which tells nothing about your content, so pretty much any other choice is better. Pick the one that best suits your needs.</p>\n<p>To choose the right permalink structure, go to <strong>Settings &raquo; Permalinks</strong> in your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-permalink-settings.png\" alt=\"wordpress permalink settings\" width=\"745\" height=\"492\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224493\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-permalink-settings.png 745w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-permalink-settings-300x198.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" /></p>\n<p>If you don’t have any preference, you can simply choose the <strong>Post name</strong> option from the list.</p>\n<h3>4.2. Choose Search Engine Visibility</h3>\n<p>WordPress comes with an option that allows you to easily discourage search engines from indexing your site with a single click. Not to mention, you should never check this option if you’re running a publicized website or blog.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/search-engine-visibility.png\" alt=\"search engine visibility\" width=\"740\" height=\"255\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224497\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/search-engine-visibility.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/search-engine-visibility-300x103.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>However, below are a few use-cases when you want to consider discourage search engines from indexing your site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Private content</strong>: You may not want to index your private content behind a paywall like a membership site, which is created specifically to your members.</li>\n<li><strong>Test / development / demo site</strong>: To avoid duplicate content penalty for your production site, you might want to de-index your development site from search engine.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic content</strong>: Similarly, you might want to discourage search engine from indexing your site if you create dynamic content that updates too frequently.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4.3. Configure WordPress Customizer</h3>\n<p>Want to instantly update your theme settings while previewing your site’s appearance?</p>\n<p>It’s now possible with WordPress Customizer. WordPress Customizer lets you preview what your site content would look like with a different theme, with different theme settings, and more.</p>\n<p>For example, you can set your Site Title, Tagline, and Favicon easily.</p>\n<p>To change the settings, all you have to do is navigate to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Customize</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-customizer-1.png\" alt=\"wordpress customizer\" width=\"740\" height=\"372\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224498\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-customizer-1.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-customizer-1-300x151.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.4. Create a Navigation Menu</h3>\n<p>Navigation menu provides a quick link to some of the most important pages of your site. In WordPress, navigation menu is a theme feature.</p>\n<p>Its appearance and display are controlled by your WordPress theme. Once you have some important pages created, you can go ahead and set up a navigation menu.</p>\n<p>To add, edit or manage your navigation menu, go to <strong>Appearance &raquo; Menus.</strong> Then, click <strong>create a new menu</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress.jpg\" alt=\"create menu in WordPress\" width=\"775\" height=\"397\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218340\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/create-menu-in-WordPress-768x393.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You’ll now be prompted to specify <strong>Menu Name</strong>.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot, our theme supports 2 different menu locations: Top Menu and Social Links Menu. Keep in mind that menu locations and their names vary from theme to theme.</p>\n<p>Next, select the pages that you want to add to the menu and then, click <strong>Add to Menu</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1.jpg\" alt=\"position menu structure\" width=\"775\" height=\"435\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218407\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/position-menu-structure-1-768x431.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can reposition the menu with drag and drop. You can then choose the menu location and click the <strong>Save Menu</strong> button.</p>\n<h3>4.5. Set Up Sidebar/Footer Widgets</h3>\n<p>WordPress widgets are simple movable elements that let you easily customize your website. You can use widgets to do a variety of things, such as displaying recent posts, popular comments, email signup box, etc.</p>\n<p>You can add widgets to your widget-ready areas of your website. Usually, this means your blog’s sidebar, but many themes support adding widgets to footer as well as other sections in the homepage.</p>\n<p>To add widgets to your widget-ready areas, such as sidebar and footer, follow the below steps.</p>\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Appearance &raquo;Widgets</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-widgets.png\" alt=\"wordpress widgets\" width=\"740\" height=\"438\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224492\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-widgets.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress-widgets-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>In the left-hand panel, you can find a list of available widgets. You can find a few different boxes on the right-hand side, which are widget-ready areas supported by your theme.</p>\n<p>In our example, our widget supports 3 different widget-ready areas: sidebar, footer 1, and footer 2.</p>\n<p>To add a widget, all you have to do is drag it to any widget-ready area.</p>\n<h3>4.6. Decide on Accepting Comments</h3>\n<p>Comments are the lifeblood of any blog or online publication. Blogs are not monologues. They’re built for having 2-way conversation with your readers through comments.</p>\n<p>With blog comments, you can encourage your readers to engage with you and other readers. But you always need to moderate your comments before it go live. That way you can ensure only legitimate comments get published.</p>\n<p>By default, WordPress allows users to comment on your blog. If you don’t want to accept comments, you can go to <strong>Settings &raquo; Discussion</strong>, and then uncheck the box next to <strong>Allow people to post comments on new articles</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/allow-comments.png\" alt=\"allow-comments\" width=\"740\" height=\"264\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224494\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/allow-comments.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/allow-comments-300x107.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h3>4.7. Decide on Allowing Pingbacks/Trackbacks</h3>\n<p>Just like comments, by default, WordPress allows pingbacks and trackbacks. Pingbacks and trackbacks allow other blogs to notify you whenever they link to you.</p>\n<p>Since most pingbacks and trackbacks are spam, it’s in your best interest to disable them on your site. To do this, you can uncheck the box, <strong>Allow link notifications from other blogs</strong> by going to <strong>Settings &raquo; Discussions</strong>.</p>\n<h3>4.8 Set Your Desired Time Zone</h3>\n<p>The default WordPress time zone is UTC +0. After installing WordPress on your site, you might want to change the time zone to your preference. This makes it easy for you to schedule your posts in advance.</p>\n<p>To change the time zone, go to <strong>Settings &raquo; General</strong> and then, either choose a City or a UTC timezone offset.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/timezone.png\" alt=\"timezone\" width=\"740\" height=\"259\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224495\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/timezone.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/timezone-300x105.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#technical-guide\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 3 &#8211; Creating a Blog – Technical Guide (Step by Step)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"plugins\">Chapter 5: Essential WordPress Plugins &#038; Tutorials</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-5-essential-plugins-and-tutorials.png\" alt=\"chapter 5 essential plugins and tutorials\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224462\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-5-essential-plugins-and-tutorials.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-5-essential-plugins-and-tutorials-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Having the right set of plugins in your toolbox is necessary to expand the core features of your WordPress blog.</p>\n<p>Every blog is unique in terms of audience, content, design, and features.

Of course, with a whopping 60% market share, WordPress beats the pants off all their competition.</p>\n<p>However, the main downside is that the post and page editors aren’t as sleek as other blogging platforms. The default WordPress editor, which now known as Classic Editor, has a word processor style interface. It allows users to input text in either Text or Visual modes. Since it had been a part of WordPress for over a decade, existing users are accustomed to this interface.</p>\n<p>However, editors of other publishing platforms, such as Medium or Ghost are way more intuitive than that of WordPress.</p>\n<p>To make adding rich content to WordPress easier and enjoyable, with the 5.0 release, WordPress will be shipped with a brand new editor, known as Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, let’s take a look at the differences between Gutenberg and Classic Editor.</p>\n<h3>6.1. Writing Content – Classic Editor vs. Gutenberg</h3>\n<p>By default, WordPress is shipped with Classic Editor, which allows users to input text in either Text or Visual modes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/classic-editor.png\" alt=\"classic editor\" width=\"740\" height=\"407\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224504\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/classic-editor.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/classic-editor-300x165.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>With Classic Editor, users can’t preview the finished page instantly while writing the content. Editing and moving different elements can also be a hassle. Users will have to switch back and forth between Text and Visual modes. They can also create spacing and sizing problems. This is where the Gutenberg editor comes in.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg editor lets you see how a finished page looks like while in the editor. That way you can adjust sizing and spacing in real time without having to switch to the preview panel. The entire editing experience has been rebuilt for media-rich content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gutenberg-editor.png\" alt=\"gutenberg editor\" width=\"740\" height=\"301\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224505\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gutenberg-editor.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gutenberg-editor-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Gutenberg separates all the elements on your content into individual units called blocks. Unlike the Classic Editor, Blocks in Gutenberg help you easily customize the style and appearance of your multimedia content without the need of using custom code.</p>\n<h3>6.2. Deciding on Choosing a Page Builder</h3>\n<p>Without a doubt, Gutenberg’s built for providing unmatched writing and editing experience on WordPress. Its goal is to make adding rich content to WordPress simpler and enjoyable. However, it doesn’t mean to replace the page builder plugins for WordPress.</p>\n<p>The built-in WordPress editors come with all the essential tools out of the box to create a basic page on your site. However, if you want to build an eye-catching page, then you might want to use a page builder on your site.</p>\n<p>Not only does it help you create a custom layout for your web page, but you can also create a stunning page without changing your existing WordPress themes.</p>\n<p>We recommend using <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/beaver-builder/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beaver Builder</a> for building a custom page. You can also check out the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-page-builders-compared/\">best page builders for WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>We hope now you have a basic idea about WordPress editors. In the next 2 chapters, we’ll explain how to create WordPress pages and posts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#plugins\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 5 &#8211; Essential WordPress Plugins &#038; Tutorials</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"pages\">Chapter 7: Creating WordPress Pages</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-7-create-a-page-on-wordpress.png\" alt=\"chapter 7 create a page on wordpress\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224464\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-7-create-a-page-on-wordpress.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-7-create-a-page-on-wordpress-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>In WordPress, you can publish content either as a post or page. When you want to publish a regular blog article, you write a post and when you want to publish a standalone web page, like About, Contact pages, you write a page.</p>\n<p>Another difference is that Posts allow you to organize the content using categories and tags, whereas pages allow you to apply custom templates and reorder them based on your needs.</p>\n<h3>7.1. Essential Pages You’ll Need</h3>\n<p><strong>Homepage</strong></p>\n<p>Your homepage is probably the first page your visitors see on your blog. To warmly welcome your first-time visitors, you might want to customize your homepage. Just take a look at an example of IsItWP’s homepage for inspiration.</p>\n<p>By default, WordPress sets your blog page as the homepage. However, you can create a page and choose it as your homepage. Before you dive in and create a homepage, below are a few things to consider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Built-in template</strong>: Check if your theme supports a homepage template. In that case, you can make use of it rather than creating a brand new homepage unless you want a different one.</li>\n<li><strong>Full-width layout</strong>: If you want to set up a homepage on your own, you might want to choose a full-width / no-sidebar layout for the page. That way you can avoid sidebar elements from your homepage and easily create a highly customized page.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose a page builder</strong>: You can find dozens of different page builders that help you create a stunning customized page on your own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you’ve a page set up for the homepage, you can go to <strong>Settings &raquo; Reading</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/homepage-settings-in-wordpress.png\" alt=\"homepage settings in wordpress\" width=\"645\" height=\"258\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224512\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/homepage-settings-in-wordpress.png 645w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/homepage-settings-in-wordpress-300x120.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" /></p>\n<p>Then select static page as your homepage and then choose your preferred homepage and posts page.</p>\n<p><strong>About Page</strong></p>\n<p>Creating an about page is a great way to build an emotional connection with your audience. On your about page, you can explain how you started, why and what values your blog stands for.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s essential for you to understand the motivations and fears of your audience before creating an about page. That way, you can create a compelling story of yourself that your audience can easily relate to. You&#8217;ll also need to figure out the right emotional ties to link your blog with your readers’ problems.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for inspiration, take a look at the about page of SyedBalkhi.com.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/About-page-example-Syed-Balkhi.png\" alt=\"About page example- Syed Balkhi\" width=\"518\" height=\"490\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224514\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/About-page-example-Syed-Balkhi.png 518w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/About-page-example-Syed-Balkhi-300x284.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" /></p>\n<p>In the about page, Syed reveals the struggles he encountered throughout his journey as an entrepreneur. Since the blog’s targeted at aspiring entrepreneurs and marketers, readers can easily forge a connection with their daily lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact Page</strong></p>\n<p>Your contact page plays an important role in turning your website visitors into customers. If you want to encourage your audience to connect with you, then make sure to add a contact form to your contact page.</p>\n<p>Compared to displaying an email address, having a contact form in your contact page makes it easier for your audience to connect with you. That way, your audience can get in touch with you without leaving your site.</p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"http://wpforms.com/\" target =\"_blank\">WPForms</a> to build a contact form on your site, which is one of the best form builder plugins for WordPress.</p>\n<h3>7.2. How to Create a Page with Classic Editor</h3>\n<p>To create a new page, head over to <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/newpage.png\" alt=\"New page in WordPress\" width=\"775\" height=\"349\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-220716\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/newpage.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/newpage-300x135.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/newpage-768x346.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can now specify title for your new page and add some content in the text area.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Page Attributes</strong> section allows you to choose a parent page. You can also nest pages based on your needs.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress themes provide you with custom page templates. Choosing a template helps you easily add structural variations to your web pages.</p>\n<p>After adding content, preview your page and then click <strong>Publish</strong>. You’ve successfully published a new page.</p>\n<h3>7.3. How to Create a Page with Gutenberg</h3>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at how to create a page using Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gutenberg plugin</a>. This will replace the Classic Editor with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>To create a page, head over to <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong>. You’ll be prompted to add a title for the post. You can then start writing content, just like the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg allows you to easily add any content block you’d like such as text, images, galleries, hero images, buttons, etc. To add a block, all you have to do is click on the Inserter tool (+).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blocks-in-gutenberg-editor.png\" alt=\"blocks in gutenberg editor\" width=\"740\" height=\"440\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224524\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blocks-in-gutenberg-editor.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/blocks-in-gutenberg-editor-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>To find the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> section, click the gear button on the top right-hand corner and then, click on the Document tab.

How to Create a Post with Classic Editor</h3>\n<p>To create your first blog post, head over to your post editor by clicking <strong>Posts &raquo; Add New</strong>.</p>\n<p>You will need to add a title to your post and start writing content in your post editor. To upload images to your blog, all you have to do is drag and drop your images into the text editor from your computer. Alternatively, you can use the <strong>Add Media</strong> button to upload your images and videos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-media.png\" alt=\"add media\" width=\"775\" height=\"369\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-218260\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-media.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-media-300x143.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/add-media-768x366.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<h3>8.2.

Adding Categories and Tags</h3>\n<p>The content of your WordPress blog is organized by categories and tags.</p>\n<p>Categories are basically a broad grouping of your blog posts. Think of it as general topics you cover or a table of contents for your blog. As they’re hierarchical, you can have as many as subcategories for each one.</p>\n<p>Tags are meant to describe specific details of your post. They can be used to micro-categorize your content and they’re not hierarchical.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to add categories and tags with Classic Editor:</p>\n<p>In your post editor screen, scroll down to the categories meta box on the right side.

There’s no value in maintaining a blog if no one wants to consume your content.</p>\n<p>Just because you published some great content on your blog, doesn’t always mean that it could bring in loads of traffic. In fact, you’ll need to to attract the right segment of readers who will love the type of content you publish. Otherwise, they won’t stick around, which won’t be profitable for you in the long run.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, we’ll explain a few different ways to promote your blog.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create pillar content</li>\n<li>Email outreach</li>\n<li>Email marketing</li>\n<li>Social media</li>\n<li>Other ways</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9.1. Create Pillar Content</h3>\n<p>Before you dive in and start promoting your blog, it’s essential for you to publish some pillar content on your site. In fact, no one wants to stick to a site that doesn’t provide value. That means, if you’re driving traffic to a blog that doesn’t have a solid foundation, like pillar content, then you’re losing some of your most valuable assets: time, money, and other resources.</p>\n<p>Pillar content is the founding stone of your blog. Usually, it’s a series of blog posts that represent your best work, but it can also be infographics, videos, or any other type of content.</p>\n<p>The main benefit of pillar content is that it brings in a rush of new visitors and backlinks. Since it provides some sort of value, your audience is more likely to stick to your blog and promote it. Best of all, it continues to attract more traffic – long after they’re initially posted.</p>\n<p>Not sure what type of blog posts you should write?</p>\n<p>Don’t worry! We’ll explain a few different types of blog posts that are proven to work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tutorials and how-to guides</strong>: Explain how to do a tedious task step-by-step, in an easy-to-follow style. This particular guide that you’re reading right now is a perfect example of a tutorial.</li>\n<li><strong>Listicles</strong>: List posts are always among the most-shared content on the internet because they’re easy to digest.</li>\n<li><strong>Latest industry news</strong>: Keep an eye on the latest industry news and blog about it. You can even explain what each trend means to an average reader, and how they can embrace the changes in your industry.</li>\n<li><strong>Controversial subjects</strong>: Talking about controversy can bring some readers to your blog but be cautious! Controversies can be highly emotional. Be aware of the language you use, and try not to be purposely malicious when expressing your thoughts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking for more blog post ideas?

Just because you’ve created a series of posts, doesn’t mean that you’ve done with content. Remember, blogging is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>\n<p>The success of your blog lies in how persistent you’re in terms of producing quality content. Now, you don’t have to produce one blog post every day. Have a publishing schedule and stick to it.</p>\n<h3>9.2. Email Outreach</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve laid a solid foundation for your blog by creating a series of pillar content, it’s time to step up and start promoting your blog.</p>\n<p>Email outreach helps you promote your blog in a few different ways: You can drive traffic and backlinks, get press mentions, offer guest posts on popular blogs, and more.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, email outreach is the easiest way to develop a personal connection with influencers in your niche. Here’s how to do email outreach, the right way.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Understand your purpose.</p>\n<p>For example, you can start an outreach campaign to offer guest articles on popular blogs. Or if you want to build backlinks, you might want to pitch influencers and let them know you’ve produced valuable content on your blog that are worth linking to.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Find email addresses based on your purpose.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to guest post, then create a list of email addresses of popular bloggers.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Use an email outreach tool, like OutreachPlus to create an outreach campaign.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.outreachplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/outreach-plus.png\" alt=\"outreachplus\" width=\"775\" height=\"364\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-217164\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/outreach-plus.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/outreach-plus-300x141.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/outreach-plus-768x361.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.outreachplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OutreachPlus</a> helps you personalize your campaign, for higher deliverability, reply and engagement. It streamlines your outreach effort and helps you produce the best results.</p>\n<p>With the right strategies, email outreach can be very effective in building backlinks and driving traffic.</p>\n<h3>9.3. Email Marketing</h3>\n<p>Did you know that 95% of your first-time visitors will never return to your site? That means if you’re not building a connection with your first-time visitors and making them visit repeatedly, they’ll be gone forever.</p>\n<p>Creating an email newsletter is the best way to build connection with your audience and encourage them to return to your site.</p>\n<p>To create an email newsletter, you can choose an email marketing software like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/constant-contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constant Contact</a> or <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/mailchimp/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">MailChimp</a>. You can occasionally send them useful emails to build a longlasting relationship. Once in a while, you can promote your recent blog posts in your newsletter and encourage your subscribers to visit your site.</p>\n<h3>9.4. Social Media</h3>\n<p>Social media is one of the most reliable traffic sources for your blog. If you’re struggling to crack the code on driving social traffic to your blog, below are a few tips that might help.</p>\n<p><strong>Set Up the Basics</strong></p>\n<p>Create a profile for your blog on various social networking sites. You can showcase those profiles on your blog and encourage your users to connect with you. Additionally, install a social sharing plugin like Shared Counts and make it easier for your users to share the content on social media.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus on One or Two Social Media Platforms</strong></p>\n<p>Focusing on every social network out there can spread yourself too thin. If you’re under a limited budget and resources, it’s in your best interest to focus only on one or two social platforms initially.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for inspiration on driving social media traffic, you can check out <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/how-we-increased-our-facebook-traffic-by-332-in-2015/\" target =\"_blank\">how to increase Facebook traffic by 332%</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimize Your Content </strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve ever shared a blog post on social media, you might have noticed that the social network automatically pulls out the image, title and description of your content. This info gives a basic outline about the content you’re sharing, which entices other users to click on it.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find a beautiful preview of your post while sharing it on social media, chances are your theme doesn’t support OG (Open Graph) tags. OG tags help social networks pull the right info from your link. If you’re having the same issue for the links you share, then you might want to check out <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-facebook-incorrect-thumbnail-issue-in-wordpress/\" target =\"_blank\">how to fix Facebook incorrect thumbnail issue</a>.</p>\n<h3>9.5. Other Ways to Promote Your Blog</h3>\n<p>Below are a couple more ways to promote your blog.</p>\n<p><strong>Blog commenting</strong>: Actively comment on popular blogs in your niche and get involved in the conversations. When users click on your name, they’ll be directed to your blog (provided that the blog you commented on allows backlinks from a commenter’s name).</p>\n<p><strong>Search engine optimization (SEO)</strong>: SEO enables you to grow your website traffic by getting your blog posts to rank higher in search engines. With onsite and offsite SEO tactics, you can drive more targeted organic traffic to your site. You can find more on this in the next chapter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#post\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 8 &#8211; Writing Your First Blog Post</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"seo\">Chapter 10: WordPress SEO: Getting Started</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-10-wordpress-seo.png\" alt=\"chapter 10 wordpress seo\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224467\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-10-wordpress-seo.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-10-wordpress-seo-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Want to drive targeted traffic to your site from search engines? Search engine optimization (SEO) can be tricky due to the ever changing search algorithms.</p>\n<p>However, with the right strategy, you can grow your organic traffic despite the constant algorithm changes. By following the best SEO tactics, you’re allowing search engines to easily scan and index your website.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keyword research</li>\n<li>On-page SEO</li>\n<li>Link building</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>10.1. Keyword Research</h3>\n<p>Keyword research is one of the most important aspects of SEO. Keyword researching helps you understand what your audience is looking for on Google.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you’ll need to find every possible combination of keywords that your potential audience use on Google to find your content.</p>\n<p>Below are a few keyword research tools that you may find helpful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Keyword Planner</strong>: Keyword planner is a free tool that helps you find the right keywords for your AdWords campaigns. You can use the same tool for brainstorming your content ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Search</strong>: Google Search helps you find a lot of related keywords for your blog. You can find the related keywords at the bottom of your search results page.</li>\n<li><strong>SEMRush</strong>: SEMRush is a paid tool that helps you find a list of potential keywords for your blog. It helps you find out what works for your competition, what site visitors in your industry are searching for, and what keywords you should focus on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have a list of potential keywords, it’s time to create an editorial calendar to streamline your content creation process.</p>\n<h3>10.2. On-page SEO</h3>\n<p>In order to rank higher on Google and position your web pages on top of search results, you’ll need to optimize your web pages for search engine.</p>\n<p>With WordPress, it’s easy to optimize your website for search engines. Here’s how to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Install an SEO plugin </strong></p>\n<p>An SEO plugin helps you make your website search engine friendly. We recommend installing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast plugin</a> on your site. Upon installing the plugin, you’ll find a meta box on every post and page editor to add SEO title, description and focus keyword.</p>\n<p>Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you’re publishing content, and then ensures you’re using it properly on that page.</p>\n<p><strong>Add alt Tags for Images</strong></p>\n<p>Alt tags help describes what’s on the image. Google places a relatively high value on alt text to identify what is on the image and the topic of the surrounding text.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal Linking</strong></p>\n<p>Add 2-3 internal links to every single post.</p>\n<p>Internal links allow users to navigate to other pages. It keeps your visitors longer on your site and more importantly, increases your link juice, which improves your SEO.</p>\n<h3>10.3. Link Building</h3>\n<p>Link building is a major factor in how Google ranks web pages. You can improve the ranking of your blog by increasing the number of high-quality links that link to your pages.</p>\n<p>There are lots of different ways to legitimately build backlinks to your site. Let’s take a look at a few of them below.</p>\n<p><strong>Create pillar content</strong>:</p>\n<p>We’ve mentioned it already but we’re saying it again. Before you dive in and trying to build backlinks, make sure you already have published a handful of content that is worth linking to. Some examples of pillar content are how-to guides, listicles, and case studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Create shareable infographics</strong>:</p>\n<p>You can either hire a graphic designer or create it by yourself using an infographics creator tool such as <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canva</a>, <a href=\"https://piktochart.com/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Piktochart</a> or <a href=\"https://www.visme.co/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visme</a>. After creating it, make it shareable by providing an embed code that your users can easily use.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach out to likely linkers</strong>:</p>\n<p>Create a list of blogs that are likely to provide a link back to your blog. For instance, you can find blogs that publish weekly recap about your niche and ask them to feature your article in their upcoming post.</p>\n<p><strong>Publish interviews</strong>:</p>\n<p>Create a list of influencers and publish a one-question interview with them. Chances are they’ll likely add a link to the interview you’ve published.</p>\n<p><strong>Guest blogging</strong>:</p>\n<p>Publish high-quality guest articles on reputed sites in your niche. While it’s an effective strategy to gain links, keep in mind that Google has cracked down on marketers who abuse this tactic with low-quality articles and links.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">&uarr; Go back to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#promotion\">&laquo; Previous: Chapter 9 &#8211; Promote Your Blog</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"monetization\">Chapter 11: Monetize Your Blog</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-11-monetize-your-blog.png\" alt=\"chapter 11 monetize your blog\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224468\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-11-monetize-your-blog.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chapter-11-monetize-your-blog-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Do you want to quit your 9 to 5 job?

Advertising</h3>\n<p>Advertising is probably the easiest way to make money blogging.</p>\n<p>You can start by displaying ads by <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/google-adsense/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google AdSense</a>, which is an advertising network by Google. The best thing is that it doesn’t require you to have a huge traffic volume to join the program.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can sell direct ads on your site. It’s effective for your blog if it attracts a significant traffic base. Since it doesn’t depend on any ad networks, you can keep the full ad revenue profits.</p>\n<p>For monetizing your site with any kind of ads, we recommend using the AdSanity plugin. It simplifies ad management helps you generate more ad revenue with minimal effort.</p>\n<h3>11.2. Affiliate Marketing</h3>\n<p>Affiliate marketing helps you generate revenue from your blog when someone purchases a product through your referrals. Basically, you choose a product you like, insert an affiliate link to that product and whenever someone purchases it by clicking your link, you can earn commissions.</p>\n<p>If you think ads are annoying, affiliate marketing is the best way to earn solid revenue from your blog. You can even use it in conjunction with advertising and other monetization methods.</p>\n<p>We use and recommend <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thirstyaffiliates/\" target =\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ThirstyAffiliates</a> for managing and cloaking affiliate links.</p>\n<h3>11.3. Freelancing</h3>\n<p>Offering your skills and expertise on your blog as a freelancer is the best way to make a living you’re your blog. Not only will you be able to showcase your portfolio on the blog, but also you can attract the right segment of paying clients.</p>\n<p>Make sure to create a hire me page on your blog and promote that page extensively.</p>\n<h3>11.4.

This is why we’ve compiled a list of frequently asked questions, so you can easily start your blog.</p>\n<p><strong>How does a blog differ from a website?</strong><br />\nA blog is just a type of website that publishes articles in reverse chronological order. Blog articles are usually published using a blogging platform like WordPress, so anyone who can&#8217;t code can start a blog with ease. Once the blog is set up, you can easily start creating content in your post editor and publish it with the click of a button. </p>\n<p><strong>Can I create a blog without WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! There are dozens of blogging platforms such as Blogger, WordPress.com, and TypePad. But we always recommend you to start a blog on self-hosted WordPress because it gives you full freedom to build a blog the way you want with no restrictions.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org (self-hosted WordPress)?</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress.com is a free blogging platform that lets you kickstart a blog with ease, but it comes with a lot of restrictions such as limited theme availability and limited storage space. Plus, the free platform doesn’t allow you to monetize your website.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org, also known as self-hosted WordPress, requires you to own a domain name and a hosting account to run a blog. With a self-hosted platform, you get full control over your blog, can monetize your blog the way you want, get unlimited theme and customization options, and enjoy unlimited storage space depending on your hosting provider.</p>\n<p><strong>How much does it cost to start a blog?</strong></p>\n<p>To start a blog on self-hosted WordPress, you’ll have to purchase a domain name for $14.99 per year and a hosting account, which costs around $7.99 per month. Altogether, starting a blog will cost as low as $110.87 annually.</p>\n<p>You can find thousands of free themes and plugins for your blog. However, if you prefer premium themes and plugins, the running cost of your blog may go higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I start a blog anonymously?</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to publish a blog but remain anonymous, then you need to make sure to protect your domain with WHOIS privacy turned on. For anonymous blogs, people often use a pseudonym/nickname to write under. You can even create a unique email just for writing your blog.</p>\n<p><strong>What should I start a blog about?</strong></p>\n<p>While you can start a blog on any topic, it’s advised to start a blog on a topic that you’re really passionate about. Or you can even start a personal blog, documenting your data-to-day life and reach out to like-minded people on the web.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I run a multi-author blog?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. WordPress comes with 5 default user roles that will help you manage and control permissions for each author on your blog.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I add an eCommerce storefront to my blog?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-create-an-online-store-step-by-step/\">Adding an eCommerce storefront</a> allows you to easily start selling physical or digital products right from your blog.

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote></figure>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"The Month in WordPress: March 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2019/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:59:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:368:\"WordPress reached a significant milestone this month.

Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\">PHP 5.6 is going to become the minimum required PHP version for WordPress</a>, a significant step towards a more modern web and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/\">updated coding standards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-2-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in beta</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has received significant performance improvements since WordPress 5.1, shaving 35% off the load time for massive posts, and cutting the keypress time (how responsive it feels when you&#8217;re typing) in half!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility continues to improve, too. The block editor now supports your browser&#8217;s reduced motion settings. The post URL slug has better labelling and help text. The focus styling for keyboard navigating through landmarks is clearer and more consistent. There are a variety of new speak messages, and existing messages have been tweaked for more useful screen-reader behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added several new blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An RSS block</li><li>An Amazon Kindle embed block</li><li>A Search block</li><li>A Calendar block</li><li>A Tag Cloud block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you keep track of these blocks, and only show the ones you need, there&#8217;s a new block management tool to switch blocks on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6806\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Block Management Modal</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on existing blocks, too. There are hundreds of bug fixes and improvements in the block editor, you can read more about them in the Gutenberg plugin releases: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-23th-january/\">4.9</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-february/\">5.0</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/\">5.1</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-march/\">5.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">5.3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The WordPress Mobile Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor isn&#8217;t just for websites, either. The WordPress mobile apps now include an experimental version of a built-in block editor. This is still under development, but you can try it out now!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-make-wordpress-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BEX89Pj6RV\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/\">The block editor is coming to the mobile apps</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;The block editor is coming to the mobile apps&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Mobile\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/embed/#?secret=BEX89Pj6RV\" data-secret=\"BEX89Pj6RV\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phase of this project (originally scoped for WordPress 5.1) is now included in WordPress 5.2.

Our latest release has already been <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/counter/\">downloaded close to 14 million times</a>, and it was only released on the 21st of February.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/w3techs-content-management-systems-usage.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Graph showing the growth of WordPress market share relative to other CMS\'s like Joomla, Drupal and others.

As various businesses use WordPress, the variety of WordPress sites grows. Large enterprise businesses all the way down to small local businesses: all of them use WordPress to power their site. We love seeing that and we strive to continuously make WordPress better for all of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone who works on WordPress, which is built and maintained by a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org\">huge community of volunteers</a> that has grown alongside the CMS. This incredible community makes it possible for WordPress to keep growing while still also remaining <em>free</em>. And of course, we’d like to thank all of you <em>using</em> WordPress for using it and trusting in it. To all of you: let’s celebrate!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6789\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.1.1 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/wordpress-5-1-1-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 03:34:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"5.1.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6736\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:369:\"WordPress 5.1.1 is now available!

In addition, this release paves the way for a better, faster, and more secure WordPress with some essential tools for site administrators and developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:5px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">Site Health</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image inline-svg\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.1/site-health.svg\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"168\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With security and speed in mind, this release introduces WordPress’s first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/php-site-health-mechanisms-in-5-1/\">Site Health</a> features.

Dana project Ethereum didapatkan dari \nsebuah crowdsale yang menjual saham berbentuk Ether. Proses ini juga \ndisebut dengan nama ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Mirip dengan IPO \n(Initial Publick Offering) tetapi ICO menyebarkan / menjual digital \ncurrency yang berfungsi seperti saham perusahaan.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDGq4aeevgY\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cara Membeli Ethereum (ETH)</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Beli Ethereum (ETH) Menggunakan Rupiah</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jika anda berada di Indonesia, anda bisa membeli Ethereum (ETH) di website:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://triv.co.id/aff/5b73b96457476\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Triv.co.id</a></strong>:\n Di website ini, anda bisa membeli Ethereum secara real time dan juga \nbisa membeli pulsa dan membayar berbagai tagihan menggunakan \ncryptocurrency anda.</li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indodax.com/ref/andryoandryo/1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Indodax.com</a></strong>:\n Exchange aset digital ini adalah yang terbesar di Asia Tenggara, \nsehingga memiliki volume trading yang cukup besar.

Teknologi Blockchain terdiri dari blok yang menampung transaksi, di mana masing-masing blok saling terkait melalui kriptografi, sehingga membentuk jaringan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beberapa negara berkembang di dunia telah menerapkan mata uang nasional berbasis Blockchain, seperti Bitcoin, dan teknologinya juga digunakan oleh beberapa proyek amal besar untuk membantu mereka yang tidak memiliki rekening bank.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Selain itu Blockchain adalah sistem yang tidak menggunakan pihak ketiga tersebut. Intinya, catatan transaksi-transaksi yang sudah terjadi, disimpan oleh banyak komputer yang tersebar di jaringan itu sendiri. Jadi akan lebih susah untuk men-hack sistem ratusan atau ribuan komputer, dan kemungkinannya kecil untuk semua komputer itu mengalami gangguan di waktu yang sama.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jadi, jika anda misalnya membayar kopi anda menggunakan&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.andryo.com/id/blockchain/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;(salah satu cryptocurrency), Bitcoin untuk pembayaran kopi tersebut ditransfer dari alamat Bitcoin anda ke alamat Bitcoin cafe anda secara peer-to-peer. Dan transaksi ini akan dicatat di seluruh komputer yang tersebar di jaringan Bitcoin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.andryo.com/img/pembelian-kopi-dengan-bitcoin.jpg\" alt=\"Pembelian kopi dengan Bitcoin\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>CARA KERJA BLOCKCHAIN</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sistem Blockchain terdiri dari dua jenis record, transaksi dan blok. Transaksi ini disimpan secara bersama-sama dalam satu blok. Hal yang unik dari Blockchain adalah setiap blok berisi hash kriptografi sehingga membentuk jaringan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dengan metode tersebut, artinya setiap blok tidak perlu memiliki nomor seri, hash memungkinkan setiap blok dapat memverifikasi integritasnya. Setiap blok akan menegaskan validitasnya dari blok sebelumnya. Keterkaitan blok bukanlah satu-satunya hal yang membuat jaringan tetap aman. Teknologi ini juga terdesentralisasi, setiap komputer dengan perangkat lunak yang diinstal memiliki salinan Blockchain yang terus diperbarui dengan blok baru. Tidak ada server terpusat yang memegang transaksi, dan karena setiap blok baru harus memenuhi persyaratan dalam rantai atau jaringan, maka tidak ada yang bisa menimpa transaksi sebelumnya.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Persyaratan transaksi lainnya, yaitu dapat digunakan untuk menentukan entri yang valid. Di Bitcoin, misalnya, transaksi yang valid harus ditandatangani secara digital, dan harus mengeluarkan satu atau lebih output yang tidak terpakai dari transaksi sebelumnya, serta jumlah keluaran transaksi tidak dapat melebihi jumlah input</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Analogi Sederhana Untuk Menjelaskan Cara Kerja Blockchain</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1) Contoh Non-Blockchain: Sebuah RT Yang Mempercayai Pihak Ketiga</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Di sebuah RT yang mempunyai 15 rumah, Pak RT mempercayai pencatatan transaksi finansial kepada Pak Budi. Pak Budi bertugas untuk mencatat siapa saja yang belum membayar iuran bulanan RT, dan juga rumah mana yang berhutang ke rumah lain jika mereka mengadakan acara makan bersama. Di sini, Pak Budi adalah pihak yang dipercayakan sebagai akuntan. Ke-15 rumah di RT tersebut, mempercayai Pak Budi untuk melakukan pencatatan yang akurat. Tentunya ada beberapa resiko di sini:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Bagaimana jika buku catatan finansial Pak Budi dicuri oleh pihak yang tidak bertanggung jawab?</li><li>Bagaimana jika Pak Budi mencoba mencuri uang kas RT?</li><li>Bagaimana jika sahabat-sahabat Pak Budi mencoba memanipulasi Pak Budi untuk menghapus hutang mereka dari catatan Pak Budi?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.andryo.com/img/rt-mempercayai-pihak-ketiga.jpg\" alt=\"RT yang mempercayai pihak ketiga\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2) Jika RT Ini Menggunakan Sistem Blockchain</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jika kita ingin mengubah RT di atas untuk menggunakan sistem blockchain, maka Pak RT memulai dengan menanyakan ke para penghuni: siapa saja dari mereka yang tertarik untuk menjadi akuntan RT. Semisal ada 9 penghuni yang tertarik, maka 9 orang ini akan mencatat semua transaksi yang terjadi di RT itu, dan catatan mereka semua pun akan identik / sama. Dengan cara ini, akan lebih sulit untuk mencuri 9 buah buku catatan, atau pun untuk memanipulasi 9 orang yang berbeda.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure

Dan transaksi ini akan dicatat di seluruh komputer yang tersebar di jaringan Bitcoin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.andryo.com/img/pembelian-kopi-dengan-bitcoin.jpg\" alt=\"Pembelian kopi dengan Bitcoin\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>CARA KERJA BLOCKCHAIN</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sistem Blockchain terdiri dari dua jenis record, transaksi dan blok. Transaksi ini disimpan secara bersama-sama dalam satu blok. Hal yang unik dari Blockchain adalah setiap blok berisi hash kriptografi sehingga membentuk jaringan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dengan metode tersebut, artinya setiap blok tidak perlu memiliki nomor seri, hash memungkinkan setiap blok dapat memverifikasi integritasnya. Setiap blok akan menegaskan validitasnya dari blok sebelumnya. Keterkaitan blok bukanlah satu-satunya hal yang membuat jaringan tetap aman. Teknologi ini juga terdesentralisasi, setiap komputer dengan perangkat lunak yang diinstal memiliki salinan Blockchain yang terus diperbarui dengan blok baru. Tidak ada server terpusat yang memegang transaksi, dan karena setiap blok baru harus memenuhi persyaratan dalam rantai atau jaringan, maka tidak ada yang bisa menimpa transaksi sebelumnya.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Persyaratan transaksi lainnya, yaitu dapat digunakan untuk menentukan entri yang valid. Di Bitcoin, misalnya, transaksi yang valid harus ditandatangani secara digital, dan harus mengeluarkan satu atau lebih output yang tidak terpakai dari transaksi sebelumnya, serta jumlah keluaran transaksi tidak dapat melebihi jumlah input</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Analogi Sederhana Untuk Menjelaskan Cara Kerja Blockchain</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1) Contoh Non-Blockchain: Sebuah RT Yang Mempercayai Pihak Ketiga</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Di sebuah RT yang mempunyai 15 rumah, Pak RT mempercayai pencatatan transaksi finansial kepada Pak Budi. Pak Budi bertugas untuk mencatat siapa saja yang belum membayar iuran bulanan RT, dan juga rumah mana yang berhutang ke rumah lain jika mereka mengadakan acara makan bersama. Di sini, Pak Budi adalah pihak yang dipercayakan sebagai akuntan. Ke-15 rumah di RT tersebut, mempercayai Pak Budi untuk melakukan pencatatan yang akurat. Tentunya ada beberapa resiko di sini:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Bagaimana jika buku catatan finansial Pak Budi dicuri oleh pihak yang tidak bertanggung jawab?</li><li>Bagaimana jika Pak Budi mencoba mencuri uang kas RT?</li><li>Bagaimana jika sahabat-sahabat Pak Budi mencoba memanipulasi Pak Budi untuk menghapus hutang mereka dari catatan Pak Budi?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.andryo.com/img/rt-mempercayai-pihak-ketiga.jpg\" alt=\"RT yang mempercayai pihak ketiga\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2) Jika RT Ini Menggunakan Sistem Blockchain</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jika kita ingin mengubah RT di atas untuk menggunakan sistem blockchain, maka Pak RT memulai dengan menanyakan ke para penghuni: siapa saja dari mereka yang tertarik untuk menjadi akuntan RT. Semisal ada 9 penghuni yang tertarik, maka 9 orang ini akan mencatat semua transaksi yang terjadi di RT itu, dan catatan mereka semua pun akan identik / sama. Dengan cara ini, akan lebih sulit untuk mencuri 9 buah buku catatan, atau pun untuk memanipulasi 9 orang yang berbeda.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.andryo.com/img/rt-menggunakan-sistem-blockchain.jpg\" alt=\"RT menggunakan sistem blockchain\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sumber:<br><a href=\"https://sudilaks.xyz/2019/04/08/mengenal-blockchain/\">https://sudilaks.xyz/2019/04/08/mengenal-blockchain/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.andryo.com/id/blockchain/\">https://www.andryo.com/id/blockchain/</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Mengenal Blockchain dan hubungannya dengan cryptocurrency','Belajar tentang blockchain dan cryptocurrency dengan analogi yang sederhana untuk mempermudah pemahaman.','inherit','closed','closed','','254-revision-v1','','','2019-05-02 05:09:15','2019-05-02 05:09:15','',254,'https://blog.afrizalmy.com/2019/05/02/254-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(219,1,'2019-04-11 13:24:19','2019-04-11 13:24:19','<!-- wp:imagely/nextgen-gallery -->\n[ngg src=\"tags\" display=\"basic_thumbnail\"]\n<!-- /wp:imagely/nextgen-gallery -->','Gallery','','inherit','closed','closed','','123-revision-v1','','','2019-04-11 13:24:19','2019-04-11 13:24:19','',123,'https://blog.afrizalmy.com/2019/04/11/123-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0);
